829-123191-0001 WHITE CURTAINS AROUND IT ANNE ROUSED HERSELF FROM HER REVERIE WITH A HAPPY SIGH I WAS THINKING OUT MY STORY DIANA OH HAVE YOU REALLY BEGUN IT CRIED DIANA ALL ALIGHT WITH EAGER INTEREST IN A MOMENT
829-123191-0002 YES I HAVE ONLY A FEW PAGES WRITTEN BUT I HAVE IT ALL PRETTY WELL THOUGHT OUT I'VE HAD SUCH A TIME TO GET A SUITABLE PLOT
829-123191-0003 COULDN'T YOU HAVE CHANGED HER NAME NO THE THING WAS IMPOSSIBLE I TRIED TO BUT I COULDN'T DO IT ANY MORE THAN I COULD CHANGE YOURS
829-123191-0004 BUT FINALLY I GOT A PLOT THAT MATCHED HER THEN CAME THE EXCITEMENT OF CHOOSING NAMES FOR ALL MY CHARACTERS YOU HAVE NO IDEA HOW FASCINATING THAT IS I'VE LAIN AWAKE FOR HOURS THINKING OVER THOSE NAMES THE HERO'S NAME IS PERCEVAL DALRYMPLE
829-123191-0005 HAVE YOU NAMED ALL THE CHARACTERS ASKED DIANA WISTFULLY
829-123191-0006 I'D FEEL AS IF I HAD A SHARE IN THE STORY THEN YOU MAY NAME THE LITTLE HIRED BOY WHO LIVED WITH THE LESTERS CONCEDED ANNE HE IS NOT VERY IMPORTANT BUT HE IS THE ONLY ONE LEFT UNNAMED CALL HIM RAYMOND
829-123191-0007 FITZOSBORNE SUGGESTED DIANA WHO HAD A STORE OF SUCH NAMES LAID AWAY IN HER MEMORY RELICS OF THE OLD STORY CLUB WHICH SHE AND ANNE AND JANE ANDREWS AND RUBY GILLIS HAD HAD IN THEIR SCHOOLDAYS ANNE SHOOK HER HEAD DOUBTFULLY
829-123191-0008 I'M AFRAID THAT IS TOO ARISTOCRATIC A NAME FOR A CHORE BOY DIANA
829-123191-0009 SHE WAS IN PURSUIT OF FAME NOT FILTHY LUCRE AND HER LITERARY DREAMS WERE AS YET UNTAINTED BY MERCENARY CONSIDERATIONS YOU'LL LET ME READ IT WON'T YOU PLEADED DIANA WHEN IT IS FINISHED I'LL READ IT TO YOU AND MISTER HARRISON AND I SHALL WANT YOU TO CRITICIZE IT SEVERELY
829-123191-0010 HOW ARE YOU GOING TO END IT HAPPILY OR UNHAPPILY I'M NOT SURE
829-123191-0011 OH I LIKE HAPPY ENDINGS BEST YOU'D BETTER LET HIM MARRY HER SAID DIANA
829-123191-0012 BUT YOU LIKE TO CRY OVER STORIES OH YES IN THE MIDDLE OF THEM BUT I LIKE EVERYTHING TO COME RIGHT AT LAST I MUST HAVE ONE PATHETIC SCENE IN IT
829-123191-0013 HE BELONGS TO ME AND I WANT HIM TO LIVE AND FLOURISH
829-123191-0014 IN HER LITERARY PURSUITS NOW SHE WOULD BE JUBILANT OVER A BRILLIANT IDEA NOW DESPAIRING BECAUSE SOME CONTRARY CHARACTER WOULD NOT BEHAVE PROPERLY DIANA COULD NOT UNDERSTAND THIS MAKE THEM DO AS YOU WANT THEM TO SHE SAID
829-123191-0015 SHE WILL DO AND SAY THINGS I NEVER MEANT HER TO THEN THAT SPOILS EVERYTHING THAT WENT BEFORE AND I HAVE TO WRITE IT ALL OVER AGAIN FINALLY HOWEVER THE STORY WAS FINISHED AND ANNE READ IT TO DIANA IN THE SECLUSION OF THE PORCH GABLE
829-123191-0016 SHE HAD ACHIEVED HER PATHETIC SCENE WITHOUT SACRIFICING ROBERT RAY AND SHE KEPT A WATCHFUL EYE ON DIANA AS SHE READ IT DIANA ROSE TO THE OCCASION AND CRIED PROPERLY BUT WHEN THE END CAME SHE LOOKED A LITTLE DISAPPOINTED
829-123191-0017 WHY DID YOU KILL MAURICE LENNOX SHE ASKED REPROACHFULLY HE WAS THE VILLAIN PROTESTED ANNE HE HAD TO BE PUNISHED I LIKE HIM BEST OF THEM ALL SAID UNREASONABLE DIANA
829-123191-0018 WELL ANYWAY IT'S A PERFECTLY ELEGANT STORY ANNE AND WILL MAKE YOU FAMOUS OF THAT I'M SURE HAVE YOU GOT A TITLE FOR IT
829-123191-0019 I CALL IT AVERIL'S ATONEMENT DOESN'T THAT SOUND NICE AND ALLITERATIVE NOW DIANA TELL ME CANDIDLY DO YOU SEE ANY FAULTS IN MY STORY WELL
829-123191-0020 IT'S JUST WHAT ANYBODY MIGHT DO HEROINES SHOULDN'T DO COOKING I THINK WHY THAT IS WHERE THE HUMOR COMES IN AND IT'S ONE OF THE BEST PARTS OF THE WHOLE STORY SAID ANNE AND IT MAY BE STATED THAT IN THIS SHE WAS QUITE RIGHT
829-123191-0021 DIANA PRUDENTLY REFRAINED FROM ANY FURTHER CRITICISM BUT MISTER HARRISON WAS MUCH HARDER TO PLEASE FIRST HE TOLD HER THERE WAS ENTIRELY TOO MUCH DESCRIPTION IN THE STORY CUT OUT ALL THOSE FLOWERY PASSAGES HE SAID UNFEELINGLY
829-123191-0022 I'VE LEFT OUT ALL THE DESCRIPTIONS BUT THE SUNSET SHE SAID AT LAST I SIMPLY COULDN'T LET IT GO IT WAS THE BEST OF THEM ALL IT HASN'T ANYTHING TO DO WITH THE STORY SAID MISTER HARRISON
829-123191-0023 CHANGING THE NAME OF COURSE OR ELSE MISSUS RACHEL LYNDE WOULD PROBABLY THINK SHE WAS THE HEROINE
829-123191-0024 I DARESAY THERE'S BEEN MANY A ROMANCE IN AVONLEA AND MANY A TRAGEDY TOO SAID MISTER HARRISON DRILY BUT YOUR FOLKS AIN'T LIKE REAL FOLKS ANYWHERE THEY TALK TOO MUCH AND USE TOO HIGH FLOWN LANGUAGE
829-123191-0025 THERE'S ONE PLACE WHERE THAT DALRYMPLE CHAP TALKS EVEN ON FOR TWO PAGES AND NEVER LETS THE GIRL GET A WORD IN EDGEWISE IF HE'D DONE THAT IN REAL LIFE SHE'D HAVE PITCHED HIM I DON'T BELIEVE IT SAID ANNE FLATLY
829-123191-0026 WOULD WIN ANY GIRL'S HEART COMPLETELY
829-123191-0027 HE DID BAD THINGS BUT HE DID THEM PERCEVAL HADN'T TIME FOR ANYTHING BUT MOONING MOONING THAT WAS EVEN WORSE THAN PITCHING MAURICE LENNOX WAS THE VILLAIN SAID ANNE INDIGNANTLY I DON'T SEE WHY EVERY ONE LIKES HIM BETTER THAN PERCEVAL
829-123191-0028 SHE'D HAVE REFORMED HIM YOU CAN REFORM A MAN
829-123191-0029 ALTHOUGH SHE TOLD HIM ABOUT IT IF IT IS A SUCCESS YOU'LL SEE IT WHEN IT IS PUBLISHED GILBERT BUT IF IT IS A FAILURE NOBODY SHALL EVER SEE IT MARILLA KNEW NOTHING ABOUT THE VENTURE
829-123191-0030 IN IMAGINATION ANNE SAW HERSELF READING A STORY OUT OF A MAGAZINE TO MARILLA ENTRAPPING HER INTO PRAISE OF IT FOR IN IMAGINATION ALL THINGS ARE POSSIBLE AND THEN TRIUMPHANTLY ANNOUNCING HERSELF THE AUTHOR ONE DAY
829-123191-0031 ANNE TOOK TO THE POST OFFICE A LONG BULKY ENVELOPE ADDRESSED WITH THE DELIGHTFUL CONFIDENCE OF YOUTH AND INEXPERIENCE TO THE VERY BIGGEST OF THE BIG MAGAZINES DIANA WAS AS EXCITED OVER IT AS ANNE HERSELF
829-123191-0032 OF COURSE IT WILL BE ACCEPTED AND THEY WILL LIKELY ASK YOU TO SEND THEM MORE YOU MAY BE AS FAMOUS AS MISSUS MORGAN SOME DAY ANNE AND THEN HOW PROUD I'LL BE OF KNOWING YOU SAID DIANA WHO POSSESSED AT LEAST THE STRIKING MERIT
829-123191-0033 ON THE TABLE LAY A LONG ENVELOPE AND A CRUMPLED MANUSCRIPT ANNE YOUR STORY HASN'T COME BACK CRIED DIANA INCREDULOUSLY YES IT HAS SAID ANNE SHORTLY
829-123191-0034 I SUPPOSE THE EDITOR IS PREJUDICED AGAINST ANY ONE WHO ISN'T A YANKEE DON'T BE DISCOURAGED ANNE REMEMBER HOW MISSUS MORGAN'S STORIES CAME BACK SEND YOURS TO THE CANADIAN WOMAN I BELIEVE I WILL SAID ANNE PLUCKING UP HEART AND IF IT IS PUBLISHED
829-123191-0035 OUT CAME THE SUNSET BUT IN SPITE OF THIS HEROIC MUTILATION THE EDITOR OF THE CANADIAN WOMAN SENT AVERIL'S ATONEMENT BACK SO PROMPTLY
829-123191-0036 ANNE TOOK THIS SECOND REJECTION WITH THE CALMNESS OF DESPAIR SHE LOCKED THE STORY AWAY IN THE GARRET TRUNK WHERE THE OLD STORY CLUB TALES REPOSED
829-123191-0037 THIS IS THE END OF MY LITERARY AMBITIONS SHE SAID BITTERLY SHE NEVER MENTIONED THE MATTER TO MISTER HARRISON
829-123191-0038 NO THE EDITOR WOULDN'T TAKE IT SHE ANSWERED BRIEFLY MISTER HARRISON LOOKED SIDEWISE AT THE FLUSHED DELICATE PROFILE WELL I SUPPOSE YOU'LL KEEP ON WRITING THEM HE SAID ENCOURAGINGLY NO
829-123191-0039 I SHALL NEVER TRY TO WRITE A STORY AGAIN DECLARED ANNE WITH THE HOPELESS FINALITY OF NINETEEN WHEN A DOOR IS SHUT IN ITS FACE I WOULDN'T GIVE UP ALTOGETHER SAID MISTER HARRISON REFLECTIVELY
829-123191-0040 BUT I WOULDN'T PESTER EDITORS WITH IT I'D WRITE OF PEOPLE AND PLACES LIKE I KNEW
829-123191-0041 THOUGH MISSUS LYNDE BELIEVES WE'RE ALL BAD BUT MOST OF US HAVE GOT A LITTLE DECENCY SOMEWHERE IN US KEEP ON WRITING ANNE NO
829-123191-0042 WHEN I'M THROUGH REDMOND I'LL STICK TO TEACHING I CAN TEACH I CAN'T WRITE STORIES
829-123191-0043 SAID MISTER HARRISON I DON'T BELIEVE IN PUTTING MARRYING OFF TOO LONG LIKE I DID
829-123191-0044 THERE WERE TIMES WHEN MISTER HARRISON WAS REALLY INTOLERABLE
