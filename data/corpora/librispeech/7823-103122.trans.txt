7823-103122-0000 THE GRAY TOWER OF THE GOOD DUCHESS ANNE WAS HUNG WITH GARLANDS OF IVY AND GAY WITH TUFTS OF FRAGRANT WALLFLOWERS AND ALONG THE FOSSE THE SHADOWS DEEPENED DAILY AS THE YOUNG LEAVES THICKENED ON THE INTERLACING BRANCHES OVERHEAD
7823-103122-0001 WOODEN SHOES CLATTERED TO AND FRO AS THE GIRLS BROUGHT WATER FROM THE FOUNTAIN IN PLACE SAINT LOUIS MEN WITH THEIR LONG HAIR EMBROIDERED JACKETS AND BAGGY BREECHES DRANK CIDER AT THE INN DOORS AND THE GREAT BRETON HORSES
7823-103122-0002 SHOOK THEIR HIGH COLLARS TILL THE BELLS RANG AGAIN AS THEY PASSED ALONG THE ROADS THAT WOUND BETWEEN WIDE FIELDS OF COLZA BUCKWHEAT AND CLOVER UP AT THE CHATEAU
7823-103122-0003 WHICH STOOD NEAR THE RUINS OF THE ANCIENT CASTLE THE GREAT BANNER STREAMED IN THE WIND SHOWING AS ITS FOLDS BLEW OUT THE DEVICE AND MOTTO OF THE BEAUMANOIR TWO CLASPED HANDS AND THE LEGEND
7823-103122-0004 IN THE COURTYARD HOUNDS BRAYED HORSES PRANCED
7823-103122-0005 FOR THE COUNT WAS GOING TO HUNT THE WILD BOAR PRESENTLY AWAY THEY WENT WITH THE MERRY MUSIC OF HORNS THE CLATTER OF HOOFS AND THE BLITHE RING OF VOICES TILL THE PLEASANT CLAMOR DIED AWAY IN THE DISTANT WOODS
7823-103122-0006 WHERE MISTLETOE CLUNG TO THE GREAT OAKS AND MENHIRS AND DOLMENS
7823-103122-0007 A BOY'S FACE LOOKED OUT FULL OF EAGER LONGING A FINE STRONG FACE BUT SULLEN NOW WITH BLACK BROWS DARK RESTLESS EYES AND LIPS SET
7823-103122-0008 AS IF REBELLIOUS THOUGHTS WERE STIRRING IN HIS MIND HE WATCHED THE GAY CAVALCADE DISAPPEAR UNTIL A SUNNY SILENCE SETTLED OVER THE LANDSCAPE BROKEN ONLY BY THE LARKS AND THE SOUND OF A GIRL'S VOICE SINGING AS HE LISTENED
7823-103122-0009 WHEN IT RESTED ON A BLUE GOWNED WHITE CAPPED FIGURE SPRINKLING WEBS OF LINEN SPREAD TO BLEACH IN THE GREEN MEADOW BY THE RIVER RANCE IF I MAY NOT HUNT
7823-103122-0010 THE BOY STRUCK A VOLUME THAT LAY ON THE WIDE LEDGE WITH A PETULANT ENERGY THAT SENT IT FLUTTERING DOWN INTO THE COURT YARD BELOW HALF ASHAMED AND HALF AMUSED YOUNG GASTON PEEPED TO SEE IF THIS RANDOM SHOT HAD HIT ANY ONE
7823-103122-0011 BUT ALL WAS QUIET AND DESERTED NOW SO WITH A BOYISH LAUGH AND A DARING GLANCE AT THE DANGEROUS DESCENT HE SAID TO THE DOVES COOING ON THE ROOF OVERHEAD
7823-103122-0012 HERE'S A FINE PRETEXT FOR ESCAPE BEING LOCKED IN
7823-103122-0013 TELL NO TALES OF THE TIME I LINGER
7823-103122-0014 MY PRETTY BIRDS THEN SWINGING HIMSELF OUT AS IF IT WERE NO NEW FEAT HE CLIMBED BOLDLY DOWN THROUGH THE IVY THAT HALF HID THE CARVED FLOWERS AND FIGURES WHICH MADE A LADDER FOR HIS AGILE FEET
7823-103122-0015 WHERE HE WAS WELCOMED BY A ROSY BROWN EYED LASS WHOSE WHITE TEETH SHONE AS SHE LAUGHED TO SEE HIM LEAP THE MOAT DODGE BEHIND THE WALL AND COME BOUNDING TOWARD HER HIS HAIR STREAMING IN THE WIND
7823-103122-0016 AND HIS FACE FULL OF BOYISH SATISFACTION IN THIS ESCAPADE THE OLD TALE HE PANTED AS HE THREW HIMSELF DOWN UPON THE GRASS AND FLUNG THE RECOVERED BOOK BESIDE HIM
7823-103122-0017 THIS DREARY LATIN DRIVES ME MAD AND I WILL NOT WASTE SUCH DAYS AS THIS PORING OVER DULL PAGES LIKE A PRIEST WHEN I SHOULD BE HUNTING LIKE A KNIGHT AND GENTLEMAN
7823-103122-0018 HAD FATHER NEVIN TRUSTED TO MY HONOR I WOULD NOT HAVE RUN AWAY BUT HE LOCKED ME IN LIKE A MONK IN A CELL AND THAT I WILL NOT BEAR JUST ONE HOUR YVONNE ONE LITTLE HOUR OF FREEDOM
7823-103122-0019 THEN I WILL GO BACK ELSE THERE WILL BE NO SPORT FOR ME TO MORROW SAID THE LAD RECKLESSLY PULLING UP THE BLUETS THAT STARRED THE GRASS ABOUT HIM
7823-103122-0020 SAID THE GIRL REVERENTLY TURNING THE PAGES OF THE BOOK SHE COULD NOT READ NO NEED OF THAT I LIKE YOU AS YOU ARE AND BY MY FAITH I DOUBT YOUR GREAT WILLINGNESS FOR WHEN I LAST PLAYED TUTOR
7823-103122-0021 AND LEFT YOU TO SPELL OUT THE PRETTY LEGEND OF SAINT COVENTIN AND HIS LITTLE FISH I FOUND YOU FAST ASLEEP WITH THE BLESSED BOOK UPON THE FLOOR LAUGHED GASTON TURNING THE TABLES ON HIS MENTOR WITH GREAT SATISFACTION
7823-103122-0022 THE GIRL LAUGHED ALSO AS SHE RETORTED MY TUTOR SHOULD NOT HAVE LEFT ME TO PLAY WITH HIS DOGS I BORE MY PENANCE BETTER THAN YOU AND DID NOT RUN AWAY COME NOW WE'LL BE MERRY
7823-103122-0023 WILL YOU TALK OR SHALL I SING WHILE YOU REST THIS HOT HEAD AND DREAM OF HORSE AND HOUND AND SPEARING THE WILD BOAR ADDED YVONNE
7823-103122-0024 AND NOT THAT OF A PEASANT ROUGH WITH HARD WORK SINCE I MAY NOT PLAY A MAN'S PART YET AMUSE ME LIKE A BOY
7823-103122-0025 IT IS LONG SINCE I HAVE HEARD ONE
7823-103122-0026 LET ME THINK A BIT TILL I REMEMBER YOUR FAVORITES AND DO YOU LISTEN TO THE BEES ABOVE THERE IN THE WILLOW SETTING YOU A GOOD EXAMPLE IDLE BOY
7823-103122-0027 WHILE SHE SAT BESIDE HIM RACKING HER BRAIN FOR TALES TO BEGUILE THIS TRUANT HOUR HER FATHER WAS THE COUNT'S FORESTER AND WHEN THE COUNTESS HAD DIED SOME SIXTEEN YEARS BEFORE
7823-103122-0028 LEAVING A MONTH OLD BOY GOOD DAME GILLIAN HAD TAKEN THE MOTHERLESS BABY AND NURSED AND REARED HIM WITH HER LITTLE GIRL SO FAITHFULLY AND TENDERLY
7823-103122-0029 AS BABIES THE TWO SLEPT IN ONE CRADLE AS CHILDREN THEY PLAYED AND QUARRELLED TOGETHER AND AS BOY AND GIRL THEY DEFENDED COMFORTED AND AMUSED EACH OTHER
7823-103122-0030 BUT TIME BROUGHT INEVITABLE CHANGES AND BOTH FELT THAT THE HOUR OF SEPARATION WAS NEAR FOR
7823-103122-0031 GASTON WAS RECEIVING THE EDUCATION BEFITTING A YOUNG COUNT THE CHAPLAIN TAUGHT HIM TO READ AND WRITE WITH LESSONS IN SACRED HISTORY AND A LITTLE LATIN OF THE FORESTER HE LEARNED WOODCRAFT
7823-103122-0032 AND HIS FATHER TAUGHT HIM HORSEMANSHIP AND THE USE OF ARMS ACCOMPLISHMENTS CONSIDERED ALL IMPORTANT IN THOSE DAYS
7823-103122-0033 BUT DEARLY LOVED ATHLETIC SPORTS AND AT SIXTEEN RODE THE MOST FIERY HORSE WITHOUT A FALL HANDLED A SWORD ADMIRABLY COULD KILL A BOAR AT THE FIRST SHOT AND LONGED ARDENTLY FOR WAR
7823-103122-0034 THAT HE MIGHT PROVE HIMSELF A MAN A BRAVE HIGH SPIRITED GENEROUS BOY WITH A VERY TENDER SPOT IN HIS HEART FOR THE GOOD WOMAN WHO HAD BEEN A MOTHER TO HIM AND HIS LITTLE FOSTER SISTER WHOSE IDOL HE WAS
7823-103122-0035 FOR DAYS HE SEEMED TO FORGET THESE HUMBLE FRIENDS AND LED THE GAY ACTIVE LIFE OF HIS AGE AND RANK BUT IF WOUNDED IN THE CHASE WORRIED BY THE CHAPLAIN DISAPPOINTED IN ANY PLAN OR IN DISGRACE FOR ANY PRANK
7823-103122-0036 HE TURNED INSTINCTIVELY TO DAME GILLIAN AND YVONNE SURE OF HELP AND COMFORT FOR MIND AND BODY COMPANIONSHIP WITH HIM HAD REFINED THE GIRL AND GIVEN HER GLIMPSES OF A WORLD INTO WHICH SHE COULD NEVER ENTER
7823-103122-0037 WHO WAS BOTH HER PRINCE AND BROTHER HER INFLUENCE OVER HIM WAS GREAT FOR SHE WAS OF A CALM AND PATIENT NATURE AS WELL AS
7823-103122-0038 HIS WILL WAS LAW YET IN SEEMING TO OBEY SHE OFTEN LED HIM AND HE THANKED HER FOR THE COURAGE WITH WHICH SHE HELPED HIM TO CONTROL HIS FIERY TEMPER AND STRONG WILL NOW
7823-103122-0039 AS SHE GLANCED AT HIM SHE SAW THAT HE WAS ALREADY GROWING MORE TRANQUIL UNDER THE SOOTHING INFLUENCES OF THE MURMURING RIVER THE SOFT FLICKER OF THE SUNSHINE AND A BLESSED SENSE OF FREEDOM SO
7823-103122-0040 WHILE SHE TWISTED HER DISTAFF SHE TOLD THE STIRRING TALES OF WARRIORS SAINTS AND FAIRIES
7823-103122-0041 BUT BEST OF ALL WAS THE TALE OF GASTON'S OWN ANCESTOR
7823-103122-0042 WE WILL ALWAYS STAND BY ONE ANOTHER AND BE TRUE TO THE MOTTO OF OUR HOUSE TILL DEATH
7823-103122-0043 AS WE SHALL SEE JUST AT THAT MOMENT THE SOUND OF HOOFS MADE THE YOUNG ENTHUSIASTS START AND LOOK TOWARD THE ROAD THAT WOUND THROUGH THE VALLEY TO THE HILL
7823-103122-0044 WAS ALL THEY SAW BUT THE CHANGE THAT CAME OVER BOTH WAS COMICAL IN ITS SUDDENNESS FOR THE GALLANT KNIGHT TURNED TO A TRUANT SCHOOL BOY DAUNTED BY THE SIGHT OF HIS TUTOR WHILE THE RIVAL OF THE MAID OF ORLEANS GREW PALE WITH DISMAY
7823-103122-0045 I AM LOST IF HE SPY ME FOR MY FATHER VOWED I SHOULD NOT HUNT AGAIN UNLESS I DID MY TASK HE WILL SEE ME IF I RUN
7823-103122-0046 WHISPERED GASTON ASHAMED OF HIS PANIC YET UNWILLING TO PAY THE PENALTY OF HIS PRANK BUT QUICK WITTED YVONNE SAVED HIM FOR LIFTING ONE END OF THE LONG WEB OF LINEN SHE SHOWED A HOLLOW WHENCE SOME GREAT STONE HAD BEEN REMOVED
7823-103122-0047 AND GASTON SLIPPED INTO THE GREEN NEST
7823-103122-0048 ON CAME THE CHAPLAIN GLANCING SHARPLY ABOUT HIM BEING OF AN AUSTERE AND SUSPICIOUS NATURE HE SAW NOTHING HOWEVER BUT THE PEASANT GIRL IN HER QUAINT CAP AND WOODEN SABOTS
7823-103122-0049 SINGING TO HERSELF AS SHE LEANED AGAINST A TREE WITH HER EARTHEN JUG IN HER HAND THE MULE PAUSED IN THE LIGHT SHADOW OF THE WILLOWS TO CROP A MOUTHFUL OF GRASS BEFORE CLIMBING THE HILL AND THE CHAPLAIN SEEMED GLAD TO REST A MOMENT
7823-103122-0050 FOR THE DAY WAS WARM AND THE ROAD DUSTY COME HITHER CHILD AND GIVE ME A DRAUGHT OF WATER HE CALLED AND THE GIRL RAN TO FILL HER PITCHER OFFERING IT WITH A LOW REVERENCE THANKS DAUGHTER
7823-103122-0051 A FINE DAY FOR THE BLEACHING BUT OVER WARM FOR MUCH TRAVEL
7823-103122-0052 SAID THE OLD MAN WHEN HE HAD DRUNK AND WITH A FROWNING GLANCE AT THE ROOM WHERE HE HAD LEFT HIS PRISONER HE DREW A BREVIARY FROM HIS POCKET AND BEGAN TO READ WHILE THE MULE BROWSED ALONG THE ROAD SIDE
7823-103122-0053 YVONNE WENT TO SPRINKLING THE NEGLECTED LINEN WONDERING WITH MINGLED ANXIETY AND GIRLISH MERRIMENT HOW GASTON FARED THE SUN SHONE HOTLY ON THE DRY CLOTH AND AS SHE APPROACHED THE BOY'S HIDING PLACE
7823-103122-0054 A STIR WOULD HAVE BETRAYED HIM HAD THE CHAPLAIN'S EYES BEEN LIFTED SPRINKLE ME QUICKLY I AM STIFLING IN THIS HOLE WHISPERED AN IMPLORING VOICE
7823-103122-0055 AND THE THIRST WILL PASS QUOTED YVONNE TAKING A NAUGHTY SATISFACTION IN THE IGNOMINIOUS CAPTIVITY OF THE WILFUL BOY A LONG SIGH WAS THE ONLY ANSWER HE GAVE AND TAKING PITY ON HIM
7823-103122-0056 SHE MADE A LITTLE HOLLOW IN THE LINEN WHERE SHE KNEW HIS HEAD LAY
7823-103122-0057 THE CHAPLAIN LOOKED UP BUT THE GIRL COUGHED LOUDLY AS SHE WENT TO REFILL HER JUG WITH SUCH A DEMURE FACE THAT HE SUSPECTED NOTHING
7823-103122-0058 THE MOMENT HE DISAPPEARED A SMALL EARTHQUAKE SEEMED TO TAKE PLACE UNDER THE LINEN FOR IT FLEW UP VIOLENTLY AND A PAIR OF LONG LEGS WAVED JOYFULLY IN THE AIR AS GASTON BURST INTO A RINGING LAUGH
7823-103122-0059 WHICH YVONNE ECHOED HEARTILY THEN SPRINGING UP HE SAID THROWING BACK HIS WET HAIR AND SHAKING HIS FINGER AT HER YOU DARED NOT BETRAY ME BUT YOU NEARLY DROWNED ME WICKED GIRL
7823-103122-0060 I CANNOT STOP FOR VENGEANCE NOW BUT I'LL TOSS YOU INTO THE RIVER SOME DAY AND LEAVE YOU TO GET OUT AS YOU CAN THEN HE WAS OFF AS QUICKLY AS HE CAME EAGER TO REACH HIS PRISON AGAIN BEFORE THE CHAPLAIN CAME TO HEAR THE UNLEARNED LESSON
7823-103122-0061 YVONNE WATCHED HIM TILL HE CLIMBED SAFELY IN AT THE HIGH WINDOW AND DISAPPEARED WITH A WAVE OF THE HAND WHEN SHE TOO WENT BACK TO HER WORK LITTLE DREAMING WHAT BRAVE PARTS BOTH WERE TO PLAY IN DANGERS AND CAPTIVITIES
7823-103122-0062 OF WHICH THESE YOUTHFUL PRANKS AND PERILS WERE BUT A FORESHADOWING TWO YEARS LATER IN THE MONTH OF MARCH SEVENTEEN NINETY THREE
7823-103122-0063 FOR THE OLD COUNT HAD BEEN AN OFFICER OF THE KING'S HOUSEHOLD AND HASTENED TO PROVE HIS LOYALTY YVONNE'S HEART BEAT HIGH WITH PRIDE AS SHE SAW HER FOSTER BROTHER RIDE GALLANTLY AWAY BESIDE HIS FATHER
7823-103122-0064 WITH A HUNDRED ARMED VASSALS BEHIND THEM AND THE WHITE BANNER FLUTTERING ABOVE THEIR HEADS IN THE FRESH WIND SHE LONGED TO GO WITH HIM BUT HER PART WAS TO WATCH AND WAIT TO HOPE AND PRAY TILL THE HOUR CAME WHEN SHE LIKE MANY ANOTHER WOMAN IN THOSE DAYS
7823-103122-0065 COULD PROVE HERSELF AS BRAVE AS A MAN AND FREELY RISK HER LIFE FOR THOSE SHE LOVED FOUR MONTHS LATER THE HEAVY TIDINGS REACHED THEM THAT THE OLD COUNT WAS KILLED AND GASTON TAKEN PRISONER
7823-103122-0066 GREAT WAS THE LAMENTATION AMONG THE OLD MEN WOMEN AND CHILDREN LEFT BEHIND BUT THEY HAD LITTLE TIME FOR SORROW
7823-103122-0067 BURNED THE CHATEAU AND LAID WASTE THE ABBEY NOW MOTHER I MUST UP AND AWAY TO FIND AND RESCUE GASTON I PROMISED AND IF HE LIVES IT SHALL BE DONE LET ME GO YOU ARE SAFE NOW
7823-103122-0068 AND THERE IS NO REST FOR ME TILL I KNOW HOW HE FARES SAID YVONNE
7823-103122-0069 WHITHER THEY HAD HASTILY FLED FOR PROTECTION GO MY GIRL AND BRING ME NEWS OF OUR YOUNG LORD MAY YOU LEAD HIM SAFELY HOME AGAIN TO RULE OVER US ANSWERED DAME GILLIAN DEVOTED STILL
7823-103122-0070 YET SHE LET HER DAUGHTER GO WITHOUT A MURMUR FEELING THAT NO SACRIFICE WAS TOO GREAT SO YVONNE SET OUT
7823-103122-0071 THE PRETTY WINGED CREATURE FRIGHTENED BY THE DESTRUCTION OF ITS HOME HAD FLOWN TO HER FOR REFUGE AND SHE HAD CHERISHED IT FOR ITS MASTER'S SAKE NOW WHEN IT WOULD NOT LEAVE HER BUT CAME CIRCLING AROUND HER HEAD A LEAGUE AWAY FROM DINAN
7823-103122-0072 SHE ACCEPTED THE GOOD OMEN AND MADE THE BIRD THE COMPANION OF HER PERILOUS JOURNEY THERE IS NO ROOM TO TELL ALL THE DANGERS DISAPPOINTMENTS AND FATIGUES ENDURED BEFORE SHE FOUND GASTON BUT
7823-103122-0073 AFTER BEING OFTEN MISLED BY FALSE RUMORS
7823-103122-0074 HIS OWN RECKLESS COURAGE HAD BROUGHT HIM THERE FOR IN ONE OF THE MANY SKIRMISHES IN WHICH HE HAD TAKEN PART HE VENTURED TOO FAR AWAY FROM HIS MEN AND WAS CAPTURED AFTER FIGHTING DESPERATELY TO CUT HIS WAY OUT NOW
7823-103122-0075 ALONE IN HIS CELL HE RAGED LIKE A CAGED EAGLE FEELING THAT THERE WAS NO HOPE OF ESCAPE FOR THE FORT STOOD ON A PLATEAU OF PRECIPITOUS ROCK WASHED ON TWO SIDES BY THE SEA
7823-103122-0076 HE HAD HEARD OF THE MASSACRE OF THE ROYALIST EMIGRANTS WHO LANDED THERE AND TRIED TO PREPARE HIMSELF FOR A LIKE FATE
7823-103122-0077 I DO IT BUT ONE KNEE I BEND FOR MY GOD THE OTHER FOR MY KING
7823-103122-0078 PAST WHICH THE GULLS FLEW SCREAMING AND WATCHED THE FISHERS AT THEIR WORK THE WOMEN GATHERING SEA WEED ON THE SHORE
7823-103122-0079 BITTERLY DID HE REGRET THE WILFULNESS WHICH BROUGHT HIM THERE WELL KNOWING THAT IF HE HAD OBEYED ORDERS HE WOULD NOW BE FREE TO FIND HIS FATHER'S BODY AND AVENGE HIS DEATH OH FOR ONE DAY OF LIBERTY
7823-103122-0080 AS HE SPOKE HE SHOOK THE HEAVY BARS WITH IMPOTENT STRENGTH
7823-103122-0081 WRUNG FROM HIM BY CAPTIVITY AND DESPAIR STANDING SO WITH EYES TOO DIM FOR SEEING SOMETHING BRUSHED AGAINST HIS HAIR AND A BIRD LIT ON THE NARROW LEDGE HE THOUGHT IT WAS A GULL AND PAID NO HEED
7823-103122-0082 BUT IN A MOMENT A SOFT COO STARTED HIM AND LOOKING UP HE SAW A WHITE DOVE STRUGGLING TO GET IN BLANCHETTE HE CRIED AND THE PRETTY CREATURE FLEW TO HIS HAND
7823-103122-0083 PECKING AT HIS LIPS IN THE OLD CARESSING WAY HE KNEW SO WELL MY FAITHFUL BIRD GOD BLESS THEE EXCLAIMED THE POOR LAD
7823-103122-0084 SO TOUCHED SO GLAD WAS HE TO FIND IN HIS DREARY PRISON EVEN A DUMB FRIEND AND COMFORTER BUT BLANCHETTE HAD HER PART TO PLAY
7823-103122-0085 AND PRESENTLY FLUTTERED BACK TO THE WINDOW LEDGE COOING LOUDLY AS SHE PECKED AT SOMETHING UNDERNEATH HER WING THEN GASTON REMEMBERED
7823-103122-0086 AND WITH A THRILL OF JOY LOOKED FOR THE TOKEN HARDLY DARING TO HOPE THAT ANY WOULD BE FOUND YES THERE TIED CAREFULLY AMONG THE WHITE FEATHERS WAS A TINY ROLL OF PAPER WITH THESE WORDS RUDELY WRITTEN ON IT
7823-103122-0087 BE READY HELP WILL COME Y THE BRAVE GIRL THE LOYAL HEART I MIGHT HAVE KNOWN SHE WOULD KEEP HER PROMISE AND COME TO SAVE ME AND GASTON DROPPED ON HIS KNEES IN GRATITUDE
7823-103122-0088 BLANCHETTE MEANTIME TRIPPED ABOUT THE CELL ON HER LITTLE ROSY FEET ATE A FEW CRUMBS OF THE HARD BREAD DIPPED HER BEAK IN THE JUG OF WATER DRESSED HER FEATHERS DAINTILY THEN FLEW TO THE BARS AND CALLED HIM
7823-103122-0089 HE HAD NOTHING TO SEND BACK BY THIS SURE MESSENGER BUT A LOCK OF HAIR AND THIS HE TIED WITH THE SAME THREAD IN PLACE OF THE NOTE THEN KISSING THE BIRD HE BADE IT GO
7823-103122-0090 CARRYING JOY WITH IT AND LEAVING HOPE BEHIND AFTER THAT THE LITTLE COURIER CAME OFTEN UNPERCEIVED CARRYING LETTERS TO AND FRO FOR YVONNE SENT BITS OF PAPER AND GASTON WROTE HIS ANSWERS WITH HIS BLOOD
7823-103122-0091 AND A QUILL FROM BLANCHETTE'S WING HE THUS LEARNED HOW YVONNE WAS LIVING IN A FISHER'S HUT ON THE BEACH AND WORKING FOR HIS RESCUE AS WELL AS SHE DARED
7823-103122-0092 HER NEIGHBORS THOUGHT HER A POOR SOUL LEFT DESOLATE BY THE WAR AND LET HER LIVE UNMOLESTED SO SHE WORKED ON SECRETLY AND STEADILY PLAYING HER PART WELL
7823-103122-0093 AND A BOAT READY TO RECEIVE THE FUGITIVES HER PLAN WAS PERILOUSLY SIMPLE BUT THE ONLY ONE POSSIBLE FOR GASTON WAS WELL GUARDED AND OUT OF THAT LOFTY CELL IT SEEMED THAT NO PRISONER COULD ESCAPE WITHOUT WINGS
7823-103122-0094 A BIRD AND A WOMAN LENT HIM THOSE WINGS AND HIS DARING FLIGHT WAS A NINE DAYS WONDER AT THE FORT
7823-103122-0095 BUT GASTON WAS WELL TRAINED AND THE BOYISH PRANKS THAT USED TO BRING HIM INTO DIRE DISGRACE NOW HELPED TO SAVE HIS LIFE THUS WHEN THE ORDER CAME WRITTEN IN THE RUDE HAND HE HAD TAUGHT YVONNE LONG AGO
7823-103122-0096 PULL UP THE THREAD WHICH BLANCHETTE WILL BRING AT MIDNIGHT WATCH FOR A LIGHT IN THE BAY THEN COME DOWN AND SAINT BARBE PROTECT YOU HE WAS READY FOR THE TINY FILE OF WATCH SPRING BROUGHT BY THE BIRD
7823-103122-0097 HAD SECRETLY DONE ITS WORK AND SEVERAL BARS WERE LOOSE HE KNEW THAT THE ATTEMPT MIGHT COST HIM HIS LIFE BUT WAS WILLING TO GAIN LIBERTY EVEN AT THAT PRICE FOR IMPRISONMENT SEEMED WORSE THAN DEATH TO HIS IMPATIENT SPIRIT
7823-103122-0098 THE JAILER WENT HIS LAST ROUND THE GREAT BELL STRUCK THE APPOINTED HOUR AND GASTON STOOD AT THE WINDOW STRAINING HIS EYES TO CATCH THE FIRST RAY OF THE PROMISED LIGHT WHEN THE SOFT WHIR OF WINGS GLADDENED HIS EAR AND BLANCHETTE ARRIVED
7823-103122-0099 LOOKING SCARED AND WET AND WEARY FOR RAIN FELL THE WIND BLEW FITFULLY
7823-103122-0100 BUT OBEDIENT TO ITS TRAINING IT FLEW TO ITS MASTER
7823-103122-0101 HE KNEW WHAT TO DO AND TYING A BIT OF THE BROKEN BAR TO ONE END AS A WEIGHT HE LET IT DOWN PRAYING THAT NO CRUEL GUST WOULD BREAK OR BLOW IT AWAY IN A MOMENT A QUICK JERK AT THE THREAD BADE HIM PULL AGAIN
7823-103122-0102 A CORD CAME UP AND WHEN THAT WAS FIRMLY SECURED A SECOND JERK WAS THE SIGNAL FOR THE LAST AND MOST IMPORTANT HAUL UP CAME THE STOUT ROPE KNOTTED HERE AND THERE TO ADD SAFETY AND STRENGTH TO THE HANDS AND FEET THAT WERE TO CLIMB DOWN THAT FRAIL LADDER
7823-103122-0103 THE ROPE WAS MADE FAST TO AN IRON STAPLE INSIDE
7823-103122-0104 WHILE BLANCHETTE FLEW DOWN TO TELL YVONNE HE WAS COMING THE MOMENT THE DISTANT SPARK APPEARED HE BESTIRRED HIMSELF SET HIS TEETH AND BOLDLY BEGAN THE DANGEROUS DESCENT
7823-103122-0105 RAIN BLINDED HIM THE WIND BEAT HIM AGAINST THE ROCK BRUISING HANDS AND KNEES
7823-103122-0106 AND BLESSING YVONNE FOR THE KNOTS THAT KEPT HIM FROM SLIPPING WHEN THE GUSTS BLEW HIM TO AND FRO MORE THAN ONCE HE THOUGHT IT WAS ALL OVER BUT THE GOOD ROPE HELD FAST AND STRENGTH AND COURAGE NERVED HEART AND LIMBS
7823-103122-0107 ONE GREATER THAN SAINT BARBE UPHELD HIM AND HE DROPPED AT LAST BREATHLESS AND BLEEDING BESIDE THE FAITHFUL YVONNE THERE WAS NO TIME FOR WORDS ONLY A GRASP OF THE HAND A SIGH OF GRATITUDE
7823-103122-0108 AND THEY WERE AWAY TO THE BOAT THAT TOSSED ON THE WILD WATER WITH A SINGLE ROWER IN HIS PLACE
7823-103122-0109 I FOUND HIM LOOKING FOR YOU HE IS TRUE AS STEEL IN IN AND OFF OR YOU ARE LOST WHISPERED YVONNE FLINGING A CLOAK ABOUT GASTON THRUSTING A PURSE A SWORD AND A FLASK INTO HIS HAND AND HOLDING THE BOAT WHILE HE LEAPED IN
7823-103122-0110 BUT YOU HE CRIED I CANNOT LEAVE YOU IN PERIL AFTER ALL YOU HAVE DARED AND DONE FOR ME NO ONE SUSPECTS ME I AM SAFE GO TO MY MOTHER SHE WILL HIDE YOU AND I WILL FOLLOW SOON
7823-103122-0111 WAITING FOR NO FURTHER SPEECH
7823-103122-0112 AND WATCHED IT VANISH IN THE DARKNESS THEN WENT AWAY TO GIVE THANKS AND REST AFTER HER LONG WORK AND EXCITEMENT
7823-103122-0113 REACHED HOME SAFELY AND DAME GILLIAN CONCEALED HIM IN THE RUINS OF THE ABBEY TILL ANXIETY FOR YVONNE DROVE HIM OUT TO SEEK AND RESCUE IN HIS TURN FOR SHE DID NOT COME AND WHEN A RETURNING SOLDIER
7823-103122-0114 BROUGHT WORD THAT SHE HAD BEEN ARRESTED IN HER FLIGHT AND SENT TO NANTES GASTON COULD NOT REST BUT DISGUISING HIMSELF AS A PEASANT
7823-103122-0115 WHO LOVED YVONNE AND WOULD GLADLY DIE FOR HER AND HIS YOUNG MASTER THEIR HEARTS SUNK WHEN THEY DISCOVERED THAT SHE WAS IN THE BOUFFLAY AN OLD FORTRESS ONCE A ROYAL RESIDENCE AND NOW A PRISON
7823-103122-0116 CROWDED WITH UNFORTUNATE AND INNOCENT CREATURES ARRESTED ON THE SLIGHTEST PRETEXTS
7823-103122-0117 HUNDREDS OF MEN AND WOMEN WERE THERE SUFFERING TERRIBLY AND AMONG THEM WAS YVONNE BRAVE STILL BUT WITH NO HOPE OF ESCAPE FOR FEW WERE SAVED AND THEN ONLY BY SOME LUCKY ACCIDENT
7823-103122-0118 LIKE A SISTER OF MERCY SHE WENT AMONG THE POOR SOULS CROWDED TOGETHER IN THE GREAT HALLS HUNGRY COLD SICK AND DESPAIRING AND THEY CLUNG TO HER AS IF SHE WERE SOME STRONG SWEET SAINT WHO COULD DELIVER THEM OR TEACH THEM HOW TO DIE
7823-103122-0119 AFTER SOME WEEKS OF THIS TERRIBLE LIFE HER NAME WAS CALLED ONE MORNING ON THE LIST FOR THAT DAY'S EXECUTION AND SHE ROSE TO JOIN THE SAD PROCESSION SETTING FORTH WHICH IS IT TO BE SHE ASKED
7823-103122-0120 AS SHE PASSED ONE OF THE MEN WHO GUARDED THEM A ROUGH FELLOW WHOSE FACE WAS HALF HIDDEN BY A SHAGGY BEARD YOU WILL BE DROWNED WE HAVE NO TIME TO WASTE ON WOMEN
7823-103122-0121 A SLIP OF PAPER WAS PRESSED INTO HER HAND
7823-103122-0122 I AM HERE IT WAS GASTON IN THE MIDST OF ENEMIES BENT ON SAVING HER AT THE RISK OF HIS LIFE REMEMBERING ALL HE OWED HER AND THE MOTTO OF HIS RACE THE SHOCK OF THIS DISCOVERY NEARLY BETRAYED THEM BOTH
7823-103122-0123 COURAGE MY SISTER IT IS SOON OVER I FEAR NOTHING NOW CRIED YVONNE AND WENT ON TO TAKE HER PLACE IN THE CART
7823-103122-0124 IT IS ENOUGH TO SAY THAT IN THE CONFUSION OF THE MOMENT YVONNE FOUND OPPORTUNITY TO READ AND DESTROY THE LITTLE PAPER WHICH SAID BRIEFLY WHEN YOU ARE FLUNG INTO THE RIVER CALL MY NAME AND FLOAT I SHALL BE NEAR
7823-103122-0125 SHE UNDERSTOOD
7823-103122-0126 SHE EMPLOYED EVERY MOMENT IN LOOSENING THE ROPE THAT TIED HER HANDS AND KEEPING HER EYE ON THE TALL BEARDED MAN WHO MOVED ABOUT SEEMING TO DO HIS WORK WHILE HIS BLOOD BOILED WITH SUPPRESSED WRATH AND HIS HEART ACHED WITH UNAVAILING PITY
7823-103122-0127 IT WAS DUSK BEFORE THE END CAME FOR YVONNE AND SHE WAS ALL UNNERVED BY THE SAD SIGHTS SHE HAD BEEN FORCED TO SEE BUT WHEN RUDE HANDS SEIZED HER SHE MADE READY FOR THE PLUNGE SURE THAT GASTON WOULD BE NEAR
7823-103122-0128 HE WAS FOR IN THE DARKNESS AND UPROAR
7823-103122-0129 AND WHILE SHE FLOATED HE CUT THE ROPE THEN SWAM DOWN THE RIVER WITH HER HAND UPON HIS SHOULDER TILL THEY DARED TO LAND BOTH WERE NEARLY SPENT WITH THE EXCITEMENT AND EXERTION OF THAT DREADFUL HOUR BUT HOEL WAITED
7823-103122-0130 WHERE THEY GAVE HER FIRE FOOD DRY GARMENTS AND THE GLADDEST WELCOME ONE HUMAN CREATURE EVER GAVE TO ANOTHER BEING A ROBUST PEASANT THE GIRL CAME SAFELY THROUGH HARDSHIPS THAT WOULD HAVE KILLED OR CRAZED A FRAILER CREATURE
7823-103122-0131 AND SHE WAS SOON ABLE TO REJOICE WITH THE BRAVE FELLOWS OVER THIS ESCAPE SO AUDACIOUSLY PLANNED AND SO BOLDLY CARRIED OUT THEY DARED STAY BUT A FEW HOURS AND BEFORE DAWN WERE HASTENING THROUGH THE LEAST FREQUENTED WAYS TOWARD HOME
7823-103122-0132 FINDING SAFETY IN THE DISTRACTED STATE OF THE COUNTRY WHICH MADE FUGITIVES NO UNUSUAL SIGHT AND REFUGEES PLENTIFUL
7823-103122-0133 AND THAT A HAPPY ONE COMPLETED THEIR JOY AND TURNED THEIR FLIGHT INTO A TRIUMPHANT MARCH PAUSING IN THE DEPTHS OF THE GREAT FOREST OF HUNAUDAYE TO REST
7823-103122-0134 THE TWO YOUNG MEN WENT TO FIND FOOD LEAVING YVONNE TO TEND THE FIRE AND MAKE READY TO COOK THE VENISON THEY HOPED TO BRING IT WAS NIGHTFALL AND ANOTHER DAY WOULD SEE THEM IN DINAN THEY HOPED BUT THE LADS HAD CONSENTED TO PAUSE FOR THE GIRL'S SAKE
