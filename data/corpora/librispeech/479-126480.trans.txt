479-126480-0000 PUSSY CAT SITS BY THE FIRE HOW SHOULD SHE BE FAIR
479-126480-0001 I THANK YOU KINDLY LITTLE DOG I FARE AS WELL AS YOU OLD RHYME ONCE UPON A TIME THERE WAS A PUSSY CAT CALLED RIBBY WHO INVITED A LITTLE DOG CALLED DUCHESS TO TEA COME IN GOOD TIME MY DEAR DUCHESS SAID RIBBY'S LETTER
479-126480-0002 A PIE DISH WITH A PINK RIM YOU NEVER TASTED ANYTHING SO GOOD AND YOU SHALL EAT IT ALL I WILL EAT MUFFINS MY DEAR DUCHESS WROTE RIBBY I WILL COME VERY PUNCTUALLY MY DEAR RIBBY WROTE DUCHESS AND THEN AT THE END SHE ADDED I HOPE IT ISN'T MOUSE
479-126480-0003 AND THEN SHE THOUGHT THAT DID NOT LOOK QUITE POLITE
479-126480-0004 AND SHE GAVE HER LETTER TO THE POSTMAN BUT SHE THOUGHT A GREAT DEAL ABOUT RIBBY'S PIE
479-126480-0005 I REALLY COULDN'T COULDN'T EAT MOUSE PIE AND I SHALL HAVE TO EAT IT BECAUSE IT IS A PARTY AND MY PIE WAS GOING TO BE VEAL AND HAM A PINK AND WHITE PIE DISH AND SO IS MINE JUST LIKE RIBBY'S DISHES THEY WERE BOTH BOUGHT AT TABITHA TWITCHIT'S
479-126480-0006 SHE POPPED HER PIE INTO THE OVEN THERE WERE TWO OVENS ONE ABOVE THE OTHER SOME OTHER KNOBS AND HANDLES WERE ONLY ORNAMENTAL AND NOT INTENDED TO OPEN
479-126480-0007 THE TOP OVEN BAKES TOO QUICKLY SAID RIBBY TO HERSELF
479-126480-0008 THEN SHE WENT OUT WITH A CAN TO THE WELL FOR WATER TO FILL UP THE KETTLE THEN SHE BEGAN TO SET THE ROOM IN ORDER FOR IT WAS THE SITTING ROOM AS WELL AS THE KITCHEN WHEN RIBBY HAD LAID THE TABLE SHE WENT OUT DOWN THE FIELD TO THE FARM TO FETCH MILK AND BUTTER
479-126480-0009 WHEN SHE CAME BACK SHE PEEPED INTO THE BOTTOM OVEN THE PIE LOOKED VERY COMFORTABLE RIBBY PUT ON HER SHAWL AND BONNET AND WENT OUT AGAIN WITH A BASKET TO THE VILLAGE SHOP TO BUY A PACKET OF TEA A POUND OF LUMP SUGAR AND A POT OF MARMALADE
479-126480-0010 AND JUST AT THE SAME TIME DUCHESS CAME OUT OF HER HOUSE AT THE OTHER END OF THE VILLAGE RIBBY MET DUCHESS HALF WAY DOWN THE STREET ALSO CARRYING A BASKET COVERED WITH A CLOTH THEY ONLY BOWED TO ONE ANOTHER THEY DID NOT SPEAK BECAUSE THEY WERE GOING TO HAVE A PARTY
479-126480-0011 AS SOON AS DUCHESS HAD GOT ROUND THE CORNER OUT OF SIGHT SHE SIMPLY RAN STRAIGHT AWAY TO RIBBY'S HOUSE RIBBY WENT INTO THE SHOP AND BOUGHT WHAT
479-126480-0012 RIBBY WENT ON TO TIMOTHY BAKER'S AND BOUGHT THE MUFFINS THEN SHE WENT HOME THERE SEEMED TO BE A SORT OF SCUFFLING NOISE IN THE BACK PASSAGE AS SHE WAS COMING IN AT THE FRONT DOOR BUT THERE WAS NOBODY THERE
479-126480-0013 IT IS A VERY ODD THING THAT RIBBY'S PIE WAS NOT IN THE OVEN WHEN I PUT MINE IN AND I CAN'T FIND IT ANYWHERE I HAVE LOOKED ALL OVER THE HOUSE I PUT MY PIE INTO A NICE HOT OVEN AT THE TOP I COULD NOT TURN ANY OF THE OTHER HANDLES
479-126480-0014 DUCHESS WENT HOME AND BRUSHED HER BEAUTIFUL BLACK COAT AND THEN SHE PICKED A BUNCH OF FLOWERS IN HER GARDEN AS A PRESENT FOR RIBBY AND PASSED THE TIME UNTIL THE CLOCK STRUCK FOUR
479-126480-0015 SHE SAT DOWN BEFORE THE FIRE TO WAIT FOR THE LITTLE DOG
479-126480-0016 VERY PUNCTUALLY AT FOUR O'CLOCK DUCHESS STARTED TO GO TO THE PARTY
479-126480-0017 JUST A SHADE LONGER I WILL POUR OUT THE TEA WHILE WE WAIT
479-126480-0018 SHE DROPPED THE SUGAR IN CONFUSION AND HAD TO GO HUNTING UNDER THE TEA TABLE SO DID NOT SEE WHICH OVEN RIBBY OPENED IN ORDER TO GET OUT THE PIE RIBBY SET THE PIE UPON THE TABLE THERE WAS A VERY SAVOURY SMELL DUCHESS CAME OUT FROM UNDER THE TABLE CLOTH MUNCHING SUGAR AND SAT UP ON A CHAIR
479-126480-0019 I THINK THOUGHT DUCHESS TO HERSELF I THINK IT WOULD BE WISER IF I HELPED MYSELF TO PIE
479-126480-0020 I DID NOT REMEMBER THAT I HAD MINCED IT UP SO FINE I SUPPOSE THIS IS A QUICKER OVEN THAN MY OWN THE PIE DISH WAS EMPTYING RAPIDLY DUCHESS HAD HAD FOUR HELPS ALREADY AND WAS FUMBLING WITH THE SPOON
479-126480-0021 PATTY PANS AND THEY ARE ALL IN THE CUPBOARD DUCHESS SET UP A HOWL I SHALL DIE I SHALL DIE I HAVE SWALLOWED A PATTY PAN OH MY DEAR RIBBY I DO FEEL SO ILL IT IS IMPOSSIBLE MY DEAR DUCHESS THERE WAS NOT A PATTY PAN
479-126480-0022 YES THERE WAS MY DEAR RIBBY I AM SURE I HAVE SWALLOWED IT LET ME PROP YOU UP WITH A PILLOW MY DEAR DUCHESS WHERE DO YOU THINK YOU FEEL IT OH I DO FEEL SO ILL ALL OVER ME MY DEAR RIBBY

479-126480-0024 RIBBY EXPLAINED THAT HER GUEST HAD SWALLOWED A PATTY PAN DOCTOR MAGGOTTY HOPPED SO FAST THAT RIBBY HAD TO RUN IT WAS MOST CONSPICUOUS ALL THE VILLAGE COULD SEE THAT RIBBY WAS FETCHING THE DOCTOR BUT WHILE RIBBY HAD BEEN HUNTING FOR THE DOCTOR A CURIOUS THING HAD HAPPENED TO DUCHESS WHO HAD BEEN LEFT BY HERSELF
479-126480-0025 SITTING BEFORE THE FIRE SIGHING AND GROANING AND FEELING VERY UNHAPPY HOW COULD I HAVE SWALLOWED IT SUCH A LARGE THING AS A PATTY PAN SHE SAT DOWN AGAIN AND STARED MOURNFULLY AT THE GRATE
479-126480-0026 SHE OPENED THE DOOR OF THE TOP OVEN OUT CAME A RICH STEAMY FLAVOUR OF VEAL AND HAM AND THERE STOOD A FINE BROWN PIE
479-126480-0027 LITTLE TIN PATTY PAN DUCHESS DREW A LONG BREATH THEN I MUST HAVE BEEN EATING MOUSE NO WONDER I FEEL ILL BUT PERHAPS I SHOULD FEEL WORSE IF I HAD REALLY SWALLOWED A PATTY PAN DUCHESS REFLECTED WHAT A VERY AWKWARD THING TO HAVE TO EXPLAIN TO RIBBY
479-126480-0028 AND TAKE IT AWAY SHE PUT IT OUTSIDE THE BACK DOOR AND SAT DOWN AGAIN BY THE FIRE AND SHUT HER EYES
479-126480-0029 I AM TRULY GLAD TO HEAR IT HE HAS BROUGHT YOU A PILL MY DEAR DUCHESS I THINK I SHOULD FEEL QUITE WELL IF HE ONLY FELT MY PULSE SAID DUCHESS BACKING AWAY FROM THE MAGPIE WHO SIDLED UP WITH SOMETHING IN HIS BEAK IT IS ONLY A BREAD PILL YOU HAD MUCH BETTER TAKE IT
479-126480-0030 PERHAPS IT MIGHT BE WISE MY DEAR DUCHESS RIBBY AND DUCHESS SAID GOOD BYE AFFECTIONATELY AND DUCHESS STARTED HOME HALF WAY UP THE LANE SHE STOPPED AND LOOKED BACK RIBBY HAD GONE IN AND SHUT HER DOOR
