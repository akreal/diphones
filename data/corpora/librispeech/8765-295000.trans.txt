8765-295000-0000 CHAPTER FIVE THE SEAL AND THE BEAR YOU KNOW DOCTOR SAID HATTERAS AS THEY RETURNED TO THE HUT THE POLAR BEARS SUBSIST ALMOST ENTIRELY ON SEALS THEY'LL LIE IN WAIT FOR THEM BESIDE THE CREVASSES FOR WHOLE DAYS
8765-295000-0001 READY TO STRANGLE THEM THE MOMENT THEIR HEADS APPEAR ABOVE THE SURFACE IT IS NOT LIKELY THEN THAT A BEAR WILL BE FRIGHTENED OF A SEAL I THINK I SEE WHAT YOU ARE AFTER BUT IT IS DANGEROUS
8765-295000-0002 YES BUT THERE IS MORE CHANCE OF SUCCESS THAN IN TRYING ANY OTHER PLAN SO I MEAN TO RISK IT I AM GOING TO DRESS MYSELF IN THE SEAL'S SKIN AND CREEP ALONG THE ICE COME DON'T LET US LOSE TIME LOAD THE GUN AND GIVE IT ME
8765-295000-0003 THE DOCTOR COULD NOT SAY ANYTHING FOR HE WOULD HAVE DONE THE SAME HIMSELF SO HE FOLLOWED HATTERAS SILENTLY TO THE SLEDGE TAKING WITH HIM A COUPLE OF HATCHETS FOR HIS OWN AND JOHNSON'S USE HATTERAS SOON MADE HIS TOILETTE AND SLIPPED INTO THE SKIN
8765-295000-0004 NOW THEN GIVE ME THE GUN HE SAID
8765-295000-0005 COURAGE HATTERAS SAID THE DOCTOR HANDING HIM THE WEAPON WHICH HE HAD CAREFULLY LOADED MEANWHILE NEVER FEAR BUT BE SURE YOU DON'T SHOW YOURSELVES TILL I FIRE THE DOCTOR SOON JOINED THE OLD BOATSWAIN BEHIND THE HUMMOCK AND TOLD HIM WHAT THEY HAD BEEN DOING
8765-295000-0006 THE BEAR WAS STILL THERE BUT MOVING RESTLESSLY ABOUT AS IF HE FELT THE APPROACH OF DANGER IN A QUARTER OF AN HOUR OR SO THE SEAL MADE HIS APPEARANCE ON THE ICE HE HAD GONE A GOOD WAY ROUND SO AS TO COME ON THE BEAR BY SURPRISE
8765-295000-0007 AND EVERY MOVEMENT WAS SO PERFECT AN IMITATION OF A SEAL THAT EVEN THE DOCTOR WOULD HAVE BEEN DECEIVED IF HE HAD NOT KNOWN IT WAS HATTERAS IT IS CAPITAL SAID JOHNSON IN A LOW VOICE THE BEAR HAD INSTANTLY CAUGHT SIGHT OF THE SUPPOSED SEAL FOR HE GATHERED HIMSELF UP
8765-295000-0008 PREPARING TO MAKE A SPRING AS THE ANIMAL CAME NEARER
8765-295000-0009 BRUIN WENT TO WORK WITH EXTREME PRUDENCE THOUGH HIS EYES GLARED WITH GREEDY DESIRE TO CLUTCH THE COVETED PREY FOR HE HAD PROBABLY BEEN FASTING A MONTH IF NOT TWO HE ALLOWED HIS VICTIM TO GET WITHIN TEN PACES OF HIM AND THEN SPRANG FORWARD WITH A TREMENDOUS BOUND
8765-295000-0010 BUT STOPPED SHORT STUPEFIED AND FRIGHTENED WITHIN THREE STEPS OF HATTERAS WHO STARTED UP THAT MOMENT AND THROWING OFF HIS DISGUISE KNELT ON ONE KNEE AND AIMED STRAIGHT AT THE BEAR'S HEART
8765-295000-0011 HURRYING TOWARDS HATTERAS FOR THE BEAR HAD REARED ON HIS HIND LEGS AND WAS STRIKING THE AIR WITH ONE PAW AND TEARING UP THE SNOW TO STANCH HIS WOUND WITH THE OTHER HATTERAS NEVER MOVED BUT WAITED KNIFE IN HAND
8765-295000-0012 HE HAD AIMED WELL AND FIRED WITH A SURE AND STEADY AIM BEFORE EITHER OF HIS COMPANIONS CAME UP HE HAD PLUNGED THE KNIFE IN THE ANIMAL'S THROAT AND MADE AN END OF HIM FOR HE FELL DOWN AT ONCE TO RISE NO MORE
8765-295000-0013 HURRAH BRAVO SHOUTED JOHNSON AND THE DOCTOR BUT HATTERAS WAS AS COOL AND UNEXCITED AS POSSIBLE AND STOOD WITH FOLDED ARMS GAZING AT HIS PROSTRATE FOE IT IS MY TURN NOW SAID JOHNSON IT IS A GOOD THING THE BEAR IS KILLED
8765-295000-0014 HE BEGAN FORTHWITH TO STRIP THE SKIN OFF
8765-295000-0015 IT MEASURED NEARLY NINE FEET LONG AND FOUR ROUND AND THE GREAT TUSKS IN HIS JAWS WERE THREE INCHES LONG ON CUTTING THE CARCASE OPEN JOHNSON FOUND NOTHING BUT WATER IN THE STOMACH THE BEAST HAD EVIDENTLY HAD NO FOOD FOR A LONG TIME
8765-295000-0016 YET IT WAS VERY FAT AND WEIGHED FIFTEEN HUNDRED POUNDS THE HUNTERS WERE SO FAMISHED THAT THEY HAD HARDLY PATIENCE TO CARRY HOME THE FLESH TO BE COOKED AND IT NEEDED ALL THE DOCTOR'S PERSUASION TO PREVENT THEM EATING IT RAW ON ENTERING THE HUT
8765-295000-0017 EACH MAN WITH A LOAD ON HIS BACK CLAWBONNY WAS STRUCK WITH THE COLDNESS THAT PERVADED THE ATMOSPHERE ON GOING UP TO THE STOVE HE FOUND THE FIRE BLACK OUT THE EXCITING BUSINESS OF THE MORNING HAD MADE JOHNSON NEGLECT HIS ACCUSTOMED DUTY OF REPLENISHING THE STOVE
8765-295000-0018 THE DOCTOR TRIED TO BLOW THE EMBERS INTO A FLAME BUT FINDING HE COULD NOT EVEN GET A RED SPARK HE WENT OUT TO THE SLEDGE TO FETCH TINDER AND GET THE STEEL FROM JOHNSON THE OLD SAILOR PUT HIS HAND INTO HIS POCKET BUT WAS SURPRISED TO FIND THE STEEL MISSING
8765-295000-0019 HE FELT IN THE OTHER POCKETS BUT IT WAS NOT THERE THEN HE WENT INTO THE HUT AGAIN AND SHOOK THE BLANKET HE HAD SLEPT IN ALL NIGHT BUT HIS SEARCH WAS STILL UNSUCCESSFUL HE WENT BACK TO HIS COMPANIONS AND SAID ARE YOU SURE DOCTOR YOU HAVEN'T THE STEEL QUITE JOHNSON AND YOU HAVEN'T IT EITHER CAPTAIN
8765-295000-0020 WELL I HAVE NOT GOT IT NOW EXCLAIMED JOHNSON TURNING PALE
8765-295000-0021 LOOK AGAIN JOHNSON HE SAID THE BOATSWAIN HURRIED TO THE ONLY REMAINING PLACE HE COULD THINK OF THE HUMMOCK WHERE HE HAD STOOD TO WATCH THE BEAR BUT THE MISSING TREASURE WAS NOWHERE TO BE FOUND AND THE OLD SAILOR RETURNED IN DESPAIR HATTERAS LOOKED AT HIM
8765-295000-0022 BUT NO WORD OF REPROACH ESCAPED HIS LIPS HE ONLY SAID THIS IS A SERIOUS BUSINESS DOCTOR IT IS INDEED SAID CLAWBONNY WE HAVE NOT EVEN AN INSTRUMENT SOME GLASS THAT WE MIGHT TAKE THE LENS OUT OF AND USE LIKE A BURNING GLASS
8765-295000-0023 NO AND IT IS A GREAT PITY FOR THE SUN'S RAYS ARE QUITE STRONG ENOUGH JUST NOW TO LIGHT OUR TINDER WELL SAID HATTERAS WE MUST JUST APPEASE OUR HUNGER WITH THE RAW MEAT AND SET OFF AGAIN AS SOON AS WE CAN TO TRY TO DISCOVER THE SHIP YES REPLIED CLAWBONNY
8765-295000-0024 SPEAKING TO HIMSELF ABSORBED IN HIS OWN REFLECTIONS YES THAT MIGHT DO AT A PINCH WHY NOT WE MIGHT TRY WHAT ARE YOU DREAMING ABOUT ASKED HATTERAS
8765-295000-0025 AN IDEA COME INTO YOUR HEAD DOCTOR EXCLAIMED JOHNSON THEN WE ARE SAVED WILL IT SUCCEED THAT'S THE QUESTION WHAT'S YOUR PROJECT SAID HATTERAS WE WANT A LENS WELL LET US MAKE ONE HOW ASKED JOHNSON
8765-295000-0026 WITH A PIECE OF ICE WHAT DO YOU THINK THAT WOULD DO WHY NOT ALL THAT IS NEEDED IS TO COLLECT THE SUN'S RAYS INTO ONE COMMON FOCUS AND ICE WILL SERVE THAT PURPOSE AS WELL AS THE FINEST CRYSTAL IS IT POSSIBLE SAID JOHNSON
8765-295000-0027 YES ONLY I SHOULD LIKE FRESH WATER ICE IT IS HARDER AND MORE TRANSPARENT THAN THE OTHER THERE IT IS TO YOUR HAND IF I AM NOT MUCH MISTAKEN SAID JOHNSON
8765-295000-0028 AND THE GREEN TINGE YOU ARE RIGHT BRING YOUR HATCHET JOHNSON A GOOD SIZED PIECE WAS SOON CUT OFF ABOUT A FOOT IN DIAMETER AND THE DOCTOR SET TO WORK HE BEGAN BY CHOPPING IT INTO ROUGH SHAPE WITH THE HATCHET THEN HE OPERATED UPON IT MORE CAREFULLY WITH HIS KNIFE
8765-295000-0029 MAKING AS SMOOTH A SURFACE AS POSSIBLE AND FINISHED THE POLISHING PROCESS WITH HIS FINGERS RUBBING AWAY UNTIL HE HAD OBTAINED AS TRANSPARENT A LENS AS IF IT HAD BEEN MADE OF MAGNIFICENT CRYSTAL THE SUN WAS SHINING BRILLIANTLY ENOUGH FOR THE DOCTOR'S EXPERIMENT
8765-295000-0030 THE TINDER WAS FETCHED AND HELD BENEATH THE LENS SO AS TO CATCH THE RAYS IN FULL POWER IN A FEW SECONDS IT TOOK FIRE TO JOHNSON'S RAPTUROUS DELIGHT HE DANCED ABOUT LIKE AN IDIOT ALMOST BESIDE HIMSELF WITH JOY AND SHOUTED HURRAH HURRAH
8765-295000-0031 WHILE CLAWBONNY HURRIED BACK INTO THE HUT AND REKINDLED THE FIRE THE STOVE WAS SOON ROARING
8765-295000-0032 WHAT A FEAST THIS MEAL WAS TO THE POOR STARVING MEN MAY BE IMAGINED THE DOCTOR HOWEVER COUNSELLED MODERATION IN EATING AND SET THE EXAMPLE HIMSELF THIS IS A GLAD DAY FOR US HE SAID AND WE HAVE NO FEAR OF WANTING FOOD ALL THE REST OF OUR JOURNEY
8765-295000-0033 STILL WE MUST NOT FORGET WE HAVE FURTHER TO GO YET AND I THINK THE SOONER WE START THE BETTER WE CANNOT BE FAR OFF NOW SAID ALTAMONT WHO COULD ALMOST ARTICULATE PERFECTLY AGAIN WE MUST BE WITHIN FORTY EIGHT HOURS MARCH OF THE PORPOISE
8765-295000-0034 MY LENS DOES WELL ENOUGH AT PRESENT BUT IT NEEDS THE SUN
8765-295000-0035 WITHIN LESS THAN FOUR DEGREES OF THE POLE LESS THAN FOUR DEGREES REPEATED ALTAMONT WITH A SIGH YES MY SHIP WENT FURTHER THAN ANY OTHER HAS EVER VENTURED IT IS TIME WE STARTED SAID HATTERAS ABRUPTLY YES REPLIED THE DOCTOR
8765-295000-0036 GLANCING UNEASILY AT THE TWO CAPTAINS
8765-295000-0037 BUT THE AMERICAN MADE ONLY EVASIVE REPLIES AND CLAWBONNY WHISPERED IN OLD JOHNSON'S EAR TWO MEN WE'VE GOT THAT NEED LOOKING AFTER YOU ARE RIGHT SAID JOHNSON HATTERAS NEVER SAYS A WORD TO THIS AMERICAN
8765-295000-0038 AND I MUST SAY THE MAN HAS NOT SHOWN HIMSELF VERY GRATEFUL I AM HERE FORTUNATELY MISTER CLAWBONNY SAID JOHNSON NOW THIS YANKEE HAS COME BACK TO LIFE AGAIN I MUST CONFESS I DON'T MUCH LIKE THE EXPRESSION OF HIS FACE
8765-295000-0039 I AM MUCH MISTAKEN IF HE DOES NOT SUSPECT THE PROJECTS OF HATTERAS DO YOU THINK HIS OWN WERE SIMILAR WHO KNOWS
8765-295000-0040 THEN YOU THINK THAT ALTAMONT I THINK NOTHING ABOUT IT BUT HIS SHIP IS CERTAINLY ON THE ROAD TO THE NORTH POLE BUT DIDN'T ALTAMONT SAY THAT HE HAD BEEN CAUGHT AMONG THE ICE AND DRAGGED THERE IRRESISTIBLY HE SAID SO BUT I FANCIED THERE WAS A PECULIAR SMILE ON HIS LIPS WHILE HE SPOKE
8765-295000-0041 WOULD BE A BAD JOB MISTER CLAWBONNY IF ANY FEELING OF RIVALRY CAME BETWEEN TWO MEN OF THEIR STAMP HEAVEN FORFEND FOR IT MIGHT INVOLVE THE MOST SERIOUS CONSEQUENCES JOHNSON I HOPE ALTAMONT WILL REMEMBER HE OWES HIS LIFE TO US
8765-295000-0042 BUT DO WE NOT OWE OURS TO HIM NOW I GRANT WITHOUT US HE WOULD NOT BE ALIVE AT THIS MOMENT BUT WITHOUT HIM AND HIS SHIP WHAT WOULD BECOME OF US WELL MISTER CLAWBONNY YOU ARE HERE TO KEEP THINGS STRAIGHT ANYHOW AND THAT IS A BLESSING
8765-295000-0043 I HOPE I MAY MANAGE IT JOHNSON THE JOURNEY PROCEEDED WITHOUT ANY FRESH INCIDENT BUT ON THE SATURDAY MORNING THE TRAVELLERS FOUND THEMSELVES IN A REGION OF QUITE AN ALTERED CHARACTER INSTEAD OF THE WIDE SMOOTH PLAIN OF ICE THAT HAD HITHERTO STRETCHED BEFORE THEM
8765-295000-0044 OVERTURNED ICEBERGS AND BROKEN HUMMOCKS COVERED THE HORIZON WHILE THE FREQUENT BLOCKS OF FRESH WATER ICE SHOWED THAT SOME COAST WAS NEAR NEXT DAY AFTER A HEARTY BREAKFAST OFF THE BEAR'S PAWS THE LITTLE PARTY CONTINUED THEIR ROUTE
8765-295000-0045 BUT THE ROAD BECAME TOILSOME AND FATIGUING ALTAMONT LAY WATCHING THE HORIZON WITH FEVERISH ANXIETY AN ANXIETY SHARED BY ALL HIS COMPANIONS FOR ACCORDING TO THE LAST RECKONING MADE BY HATTERAS
8765-295000-0046 AND THE QUESTION OF LIFE OR DEATH WOULD BE DECIDED BEFORE THE DAY WAS OVER AT LAST ABOUT TWO O'CLOCK IN THE AFTERNOON ALTAMONT STARTED UP WITH A SHOUT THAT ARRESTED THE WHOLE PARTY
8765-295000-0047 AND POINTING TO A WHITE MASS THAT NO EYE BUT HIS COULD HAVE DISTINGUISHED FROM THE SURROUNDING ICEBERGS EXCLAIMED IN A LOUD RINGING VOICE
