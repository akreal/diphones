328-129766-0000 AND SO MIGHT MARRY AGAIN WHEN HE WOULD
328-129766-0001 AND TO ASSIST AND SUPPORT ME AS LONG AS I LIVED AND THAT IF HE DIED BEFORE ME HE WOULD LEAVE SUFFICIENT TO HIS MOTHER TO TAKE CARE OF ME STILL IN THE NAME OF A SISTER AND HE WAS IN SOME RESPECTS CAREFUL OF ME WHEN HE HEARD OF ME
328-129766-0002 AS YOU SHALL HEAR IN ITS TIME I CAME AWAY FOR ENGLAND IN THE MONTH OF AUGUST AFTER I HAD BEEN EIGHT YEARS IN THAT COUNTRY AND NOW A NEW SCENE OF MISFORTUNES ATTENDED ME WHICH PERHAPS FEW WOMEN HAVE GONE THROUGH THE LIFE OF
328-129766-0003 WE HAD AN INDIFFERENT GOOD VOYAGE TILL WE CAME JUST UPON THE COAST OF ENGLAND AND WHERE WE ARRIVED IN TWO AND THIRTY DAYS BUT WERE THEN RUFFLED WITH TWO OR THREE STORMS
328-129766-0004 GOT SOME REFRESHMENT ON SHORE AND PUT TO SEA AGAIN THOUGH WE MET WITH VERY BAD WEATHER AGAIN IN WHICH THE SHIP SPRUNG HER MAINMAST AS THEY CALLED IT FOR I KNEW NOT WHAT THEY MEANT BUT WE GOT AT LAST INTO MILFORD HAVEN IN WALES
328-129766-0005 WHERE THOUGH IT WAS REMOTE FROM OUR PORT
328-129766-0006 THE ISLE OF BRITAIN I RESOLVED TO VENTURE IT NO MORE UPON THE WATERS WHICH HAD BEEN SO TERRIBLE TO ME SO GETTING MY CLOTHES AND MONEY ON SHORE WITH MY BILLS OF LOADING AND OTHER PAPERS I RESOLVED TO COME FOR LONDON
328-129766-0007 THE PORT WHITHER SHE WAS BOUND WAS TO BRISTOL WHERE MY BROTHER'S CHIEF CORRESPONDENT LIVED I GOT TO LONDON IN ABOUT THREE WEEKS WHERE I HEARD A LITTLE WHILE AFTER THAT THE SHIP WAS ARRIVED IN BRISTOL
328-129766-0008 THE BREAKING OF HER MAINMAST SHE HAD GREAT DAMAGE ON BOARD AND THAT A GREAT PART OF HER CARGO WAS SPOILED I HAD NOW A NEW SCENE OF LIFE UPON MY HANDS AND A DREADFUL APPEARANCE IT HAD I WAS COME AWAY WITH A KIND OF FINAL FAREWELL
328-129766-0009 WHAT I BROUGHT WITH ME WAS INDEED CONSIDERABLE HAD IT COME SAFE AND BY THE HELP OF IT I MIGHT HAVE MARRIED AGAIN TOLERABLY WELL BUT AS IT WAS I WAS REDUCED TO BETWEEN TWO OR THREE HUNDRED POUNDS IN THE WHOLE AND THIS WITHOUT ANY HOPE OF RECRUIT
328-129766-0010 I WAS ENTIRELY WITHOUT FRIENDS NAY EVEN SO MUCH AS WITHOUT ACQUAINTANCE
328-129766-0011 THAT SET ME UP FORMERLY FOR A FORTUNE SHE WAS DEAD AND HER HUSBAND ALSO AS I WAS INFORMED UPON SENDING A PERSON UNKNOWN TO INQUIRE THE LOOKING AFTER MY CARGO OF GOODS SOON AFTER OBLIGED ME TO TAKE A JOURNEY TO BRISTOL AND DURING MY ATTENDANCE UPON THAT AFFAIR
328-129766-0012 I TOOK THE DIVERSION OF GOING TO THE BATH FOR AS I WAS STILL FAR FROM BEING OLD SO MY HUMOUR WHICH WAS ALWAYS GAY CONTINUED SO TO AN EXTREME AND BEING NOW AS IT WERE A WOMAN OF FORTUNE THOUGH I WAS A WOMAN WITHOUT A FORTUNE
328-129766-0013 AS HAD BEEN MY CASE BEFORE THE BATH IS A PLACE OF GALLANTRY ENOUGH EXPENSIVE AND FULL OF SNARES I WENT THITHER INDEED
328-129766-0014 BUT I MUST DO MYSELF JUSTICE AS TO PROTEST I KNEW NOTHING AMISS I MEANT NOTHING BUT IN AN HONEST WAY NOR HAD I ANY THOUGHTS ABOUT ME AT FIRST THAT LOOKED THE WAY WHICH AFTERWARDS I SUFFERED THEM TO BE GUIDED
328-129766-0015 AS IT IS CALLED THERE AND CONTRACTED SOME UNHAPPY ACQUAINTANCES WHICH RATHER PROMPTED THE FOLLIES I FELL AFTERWARDS INTO THAN FORTIFIED ME AGAINST THEM I LIVED PLEASANTLY ENOUGH KEPT GOOD COMPANY THAT IS TO SAY GAY FINE COMPANY
328-129766-0016 BUT HAD THE DISCOURAGEMENT TO FIND THIS WAY OF LIVING SUNK ME EXCEEDINGLY AND THAT AS I HAD NO SETTLED INCOME SO SPENDING UPON THE MAIN STOCK WAS BUT A CERTAIN KIND OF BLEEDING TO DEATH AND THIS GAVE ME MANY SAD REFLECTIONS IN THE INTERVAL OF MY OTHER THOUGHTS
328-129766-0017 HOWEVER I SHOOK THEM OFF
328-129766-0018 BUT I WAS IN THE WRONG PLACE FOR IT I WAS NOT NOW AT REDRIFF WHERE IF I HAD SET MYSELF TOLERABLY UP SOME HONEST SEA CAPTAIN OR OTHER MIGHT HAVE TALKED WITH ME UPON THE HONOURABLE TERMS OF MATRIMONY BUT I WAS AT THE BATH
328-129766-0019 WHERE MEN FIND A MISTRESS SOMETIMES BUT VERY RARELY LOOK FOR A WIFE AND CONSEQUENTLY ALL THE PARTICULAR ACQUAINTANCES A WOMAN CAN EXPECT TO MAKE THERE MUST HAVE SOME TENDENCY THAT WAY I HAD SPENT THE FIRST SEASON WELL ENOUGH
328-129766-0020 FOR THOUGH I HAD CONTRACTED SOME ACQUAINTANCE WITH A GENTLEMAN WHO CAME TO THE BATH FOR HIS DIVERSION
328-129766-0021 AS IT MIGHT BE CALLED I HAD RESISTED SOME CASUAL OFFERS OF GALLANTRY AND HAD MANAGED THAT WAY WELL ENOUGH I WAS NOT WICKED ENOUGH TO COME INTO THE CRIME FOR THE MERE VICE OF IT AND I HAD NO EXTRAORDINARY OFFERS MADE ME THAT TEMPTED ME WITH THE MAIN THING WHICH I WANTED
328-129766-0022 I CONTRACTED AN ACQUAINTANCE WITH A WOMAN IN WHOSE HOUSE I LODGED WHO THOUGH SHE DID NOT KEEP AN ILL HOUSE AS WE CALL IT YET HAD NONE OF THE BEST PRINCIPLES IN HERSELF I HAD ON ALL OCCASIONS BEHAVED MYSELF SO WELL
328-129766-0023 AS NOT TO GET THE LEAST SLUR UPON MY REPUTATION ON ANY ACCOUNT WHATEVER AND ALL THE MEN THAT I HAD CONVERSED WITH WERE OF SO GOOD REPUTATION THAT I HAD NOT GIVEN THE LEAST REFLECTION BY CONVERSING WITH THEM
328-129766-0024 FOR A WICKED CORRESPONDENCE IF THEY HAD ANY OF THEM OFFERED IT YET THERE WAS ONE GENTLEMAN AS ABOVE WHO ALWAYS SINGLED ME OUT FOR THE DIVERSION OF MY COMPANY AS HE CALLED IT WHICH AS HE WAS PLEASED TO SAY WAS VERY AGREEABLE TO HIM BUT AT THAT TIME
328-129766-0025 THERE WAS NO MORE IN IT I HAD MANY MELANCHOLY HOURS AT THE BATH AFTER THE COMPANY WAS GONE
328-129766-0026 AND FOR RECRUITS OF MONEY YET I CHOSE TO COME BACK TO BATH FOR MY RESIDENCE BECAUSE BEING ON GOOD TERMS WITH THE WOMAN IN WHOSE HOUSE I LODGED IN THE SUMMER I FOUND THAT DURING THE WINTER I LIVED RATHER CHEAPER THERE
328-129766-0027 HERE I SAY I PASSED THE WINTER AS HEAVILY AS I HAD PASSED THE AUTUMN CHEERFULLY
328-129766-0028 OF WHAT LAY HARDEST UPON MY MIND AND PARTICULARLY THE NARROWNESS OF MY CIRCUMSTANCES AND THE LOSS OF MY FORTUNE BY THE DAMAGE OF MY GOODS AT SEA I TOLD HER ALSO THAT I HAD A MOTHER AND A BROTHER IN VIRGINIA IN GOOD CIRCUMSTANCES
328-129766-0029 AND AS I HAD REALLY WRITTEN BACK TO MY MOTHER IN PARTICULAR TO REPRESENT MY CONDITION AND THE GREAT LOSS I HAD RECEIVED
328-129766-0030 SO I DID NOT FAIL TO LET MY NEW FRIEND KNOW THAT I EXPECTED A SUPPLY FROM THENCE AND SO INDEED I DID AND AS THE SHIPS WENT FROM BRISTOL TO YORK RIVER IN VIRGINIA AND BACK AGAIN GENERALLY IN LESS TIME FROM LONDON
328-129766-0031 AND THAT MY BROTHER CORRESPONDED CHIEFLY AT BRISTOL I THOUGHT IT WAS MUCH BETTER FOR ME TO WAIT HERE FOR MY RETURNS THAN TO GO TO LONDON WHERE ALSO I HAD NOT THE LEAST ACQUAINTANCE MY NEW FRIEND APPEARED SENSIBLY AFFECTED WITH MY CONDITION
328-129766-0032 AND INDEED WAS SO VERY KIND AS TO REDUCE THE RATE OF MY LIVING WITH HER TO SO LOW A PRICE DURING THE WINTER THAT SHE CONVINCED ME SHE GOT NOTHING BY ME AND AS FOR LODGING DURING THE WINTER I PAID NOTHING AT ALL
328-129766-0033 TILL IT WAS FOUND NECESSARY TO DO OTHERWISE SHE HAD SOME PERSONS OF CHARACTER THAT FREQUENTLY LODGED IN HER HOUSE AND IN PARTICULAR THE GENTLEMAN WHO AS I SAID SINGLED ME OUT FOR HIS COMPANION
328-129766-0034 THE WINTER BEFORE AND HE CAME DOWN AGAIN WITH ANOTHER GENTLEMAN IN HIS COMPANY AND TWO SERVANTS AND LODGED IN THE SAME HOUSE
328-129766-0035 LETTING HIM KNOW THAT I WAS STILL WITH HER BUT SHE DENIED IT AND PROTESTED TO ME THAT SHE DID NOT AND HE SAID THE SAME IN A WORD THIS GENTLEMAN CAME DOWN AND CONTINUED TO SINGLE ME OUT FOR HIS PECULIAR CONFIDENCE AS WELL AS CONVERSATION
328-129766-0036 IF I MIGHT BELIEVE HIM WAS TO HIM
328-129766-0037 AND HE HAD SUCH AN OPINION OF MY VIRTUE THAT AS HE OFTEN PROFESSED HE BELIEVED IF HE SHOULD OFFER ANYTHING ELSE I SHOULD REJECT HIM WITH CONTEMPT HE SOON UNDERSTOOD FROM ME THAT I WAS A WIDOW THAT I HAD ARRIVED AT BRISTOL FROM VIRGINIA BY THE LAST SHIPS
328-129766-0038 AND THAT I WAITED AT BATH TILL THE NEXT VIRGINIA FLEET SHOULD ARRIVE BY WHICH I EXPECTED CONSIDERABLE EFFECTS I UNDERSTOOD BY HIM AND BY OTHERS OF HIM THAT HE HAD A WIFE BUT THAT THE LADY WAS DISTEMPERED IN HER HEAD AND WAS UNDER THE CONDUCT
328-129766-0039 OF HER OWN RELATIONS WHICH HE CONSENTED TO TO AVOID ANY REFLECTIONS THAT MIGHT AS WAS NOT UNUSUAL IN SUCH CASES BE CAST ON HIM FOR MISMANAGING HER CURE AND IN THE MEANTIME HE CAME TO THE BATH TO DIVERT HIS THOUGHTS
328-129766-0040 FROM THE DISTURBANCE OF SUCH A MELANCHOLY CIRCUMSTANCE AS THAT WAS MY LANDLADY WHO OF HER OWN ACCORD ENCOURAGED THE CORRESPONDENCE ON ALL OCCASIONS GAVE ME AN ADVANTAGEOUS CHARACTER OF HIM
328-129766-0041 AS A MAN OF HONOUR AND OF VIRTUE AS WELL AS OF GREAT ESTATE AND INDEED I HAD A GREAT DEAL OF REASON TO SAY SO OF HIM TOO FOR THOUGH WE LODGED BOTH ON A FLOOR AND HE HAD FREQUENTLY COME INTO MY CHAMBER EVEN WHEN I WAS IN BED
328-129766-0042 AND I ALSO INTO HIS WHEN HE WAS IN BED YET HE NEVER OFFERED ANYTHING TO ME FURTHER THAN A KISS OR SO MUCH AS SOLICITED ME TO ANYTHING TILL LONG AFTER AS YOU SHALL HEAR
328-129766-0043 AND SHE AGAIN USED TO TELL ME SHE BELIEVED IT WAS SO FROM THE BEGINNING HOWEVER SHE USED TO TELL ME THAT SHE THOUGHT I OUGHT TO EXPECT SOME GRATIFICATION FROM HIM FOR MY COMPANY FOR INDEED HE DID AS IT WERE ENGROSS ME AND I WAS SELDOM FROM HIM
328-129766-0044 I TOLD HER I HAD NOT GIVEN HIM THE LEAST OCCASION TO THINK I WANTED IT
328-129766-0045 AND SHE DID SO AND MANAGED IT SO DEXTEROUSLY
328-129766-0046 AND SO I PUT OFF ALL ROOM FOR ANY OFFER FOR THE PRESENT HOWEVER IT WAS NOT LONG BEFORE HE ATTACKED ME AGAIN
328-129766-0047 WHICH HE WAS SORRY FOR ASSURING ME THAT HE INQUIRED INTO IT WITH NO DESIGN TO SATISFY HIS OWN CURIOSITY BUT MERELY TO ASSIST ME IF THERE WAS ANY OCCASION BUT SINCE I
328-129766-0048 IN NEED OF ANY ASSISTANCE HE HAD BUT ONE THING MORE TO DESIRE OF ME AND THAT WAS THAT I WOULD PROMISE HIM THAT WHEN I WAS ANY WAY STRAITENED OR LIKE TO BE SO I WOULD FRANKLY TELL HIM OF IT AND THAT I WOULD MAKE USE OF HIM WITH THE SAME FREEDOM THAT HE MADE THE OFFER
328-129766-0049 ADDING THAT I SHOULD ALWAYS FIND I HAD A TRUE FRIEND THOUGH PERHAPS I WAS AFRAID TO TRUST HIM I OMITTED NOTHING THAT WAS FIT TO BE SAID BY ONE INFINITELY OBLIGED TO LET HIM KNOW THAT I HAD A DUE SENSE OF HIS KINDNESS
328-129766-0050 AND INDEED FROM THAT TIME I DID NOT APPEAR SO MUCH RESERVED TO HIM AS I HAD DONE BEFORE THOUGH STILL WITHIN THE BOUNDS OF THE STRICTEST VIRTUE ON BOTH SIDES BUT HOW FREE SOEVER OUR CONVERSATION WAS I COULD NOT ARRIVE TO THAT SORT OF FREEDOM
328-129766-0051 THOUGH I WAS SECRETLY VERY GLAD OF HIS OFFER SOME WEEKS PASSED AFTER THIS AND STILL I NEVER ASKED HIM FOR MONEY WHEN MY LANDLADY A CUNNING CREATURE WHO HAD OFTEN PRESSED ME TO IT BUT FOUND THAT I COULD NOT DO IT
328-129766-0052 MAKES A STORY OF HER OWN INVENTING AND COMES IN
328-129766-0053 OH WIDOW SAYS SHE I HAVE BAD NEWS TO TELL YOU THIS MORNING WHAT IS THAT SAID I ARE THE VIRGINIA SHIPS TAKEN BY THE FRENCH FOR THAT WAS MY FEAR NO NO SAYS SHE
328-129766-0054 BUT THE MAN YOU SENT TO BRISTOL YESTERDAY FOR MONEY IS COME BACK AND SAYS HE HAS BROUGHT NONE NOW I COULD BY NO MEANS LIKE HER PROJECT
328-129766-0055 WHICH INDEED HE DID NOT WANT AND I CLEARLY SAW THAT I SHOULD LOSE NOTHING BY BEING BACKWARD TO ASK SO I TOOK HER UP SHORT
328-129766-0056 SAID I FOR I ASSURE YOU HE BROUGHT ME ALL THE MONEY I SENT HIM FOR AND HERE IT IS SAID I PULLING OUT MY PURSE WITH ABOUT TWELVE GUINEAS IN IT AND ADDED I INTEND YOU SHALL HAVE MOST OF IT BY AND BY HE SEEMED DISTASTED A LITTLE AT HER TALKING
328-129766-0057 AS SHE DID AT FIRST AS WELL AS I TAKING IT AS I FANCIED HE WOULD AS SOMETHING FORWARD OF HER BUT WHEN HE SAW ME GIVE SUCH AN ANSWER HE CAME IMMEDIATELY TO HIMSELF AGAIN THE NEXT MORNING WE TALKED OF IT AGAIN WHEN I FOUND HE WAS FULLY SATISFIED
328-129766-0058 AND SMILING SAID HE HOPED I WOULD NOT WANT MONEY AND NOT TELL HIM OF IT AND THAT I HAD PROMISED HIM OTHERWISE I TOLD HIM I HAD BEEN VERY MUCH DISSATISFIED AT MY LANDLADY'S TALKING SO PUBLICLY THE DAY BEFORE OF WHAT SHE HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH
328-129766-0059 BUT I SUPPOSED SHE WANTED WHAT I OWED HER WHICH WAS ABOUT EIGHT GUINEAS WHICH I HAD RESOLVED TO GIVE HER AND HAD ACCORDINGLY
328-129766-0060 HE WAS IN A MIGHT GOOD HUMOUR WHEN HE HEARD ME SAY I HAD PAID HER AND IT WENT OFF INTO SOME OTHER DISCOURSE AT THAT TIME BUT THE NEXT MORNING HE HAVING HEARD ME UP ABOUT MY ROOM BEFORE HIM HE CALLED TO ME AND I ANSWERING HE ASKED ME TO COME INTO HIS CHAMBER
328-129766-0061 FOR HE SAID HE HAD SOMETHING TO SAY TO ME WHICH WAS OF SOME MOMENT AFTER SOME VERY KIND EXPRESSIONS HE ASKED ME IF I WOULD BE VERY HONEST TO HIM AND GIVE A SINCERE ANSWER TO ONE THING HE WOULD DESIRE OF ME
328-129766-0062 AT THE WORD SINCERE AND ASKING HIM IF I HAD EVER GIVEN HIM ANY ANSWERS WHICH WERE NOT SINCERE I PROMISED HIM I WOULD WHY THEN HIS REQUEST WAS HE SAID TO LET HIM SEE MY PURSE
328-129766-0063 I IMMEDIATELY PUT MY HAND INTO MY POCKET AND LAUGHING TO HIM PULLED IT OUT AND THERE WAS IN IT THREE GUINEAS AND A HALF
328-129766-0064 NOT BY A GREAT DEAL WELL THEN HE SAID HE WOULD HAVE ME PROMISE TO GO AND FETCH HIM ALL THE MONEY I HAD EVERY FARTHING I TOLD HIM I WOULD AND I WENT INTO MY CHAMBER AND FETCHED HIM A LITTLE PRIVATE DRAWER
328-129766-0065 WHERE I HAD ABOUT SIX GUINEAS MORE AND SOME SILVER AND THREW IT ALL DOWN UPON THE BED AND TOLD HIM THERE WAS ALL MY WEALTH HONESTLY TO A SHILLING HE LOOKED A LITTLE AT IT BUT DID NOT TELL IT
328-129766-0066 AND THEN REACHING HIS POCKET PULLED OUT A KEY AND BADE ME OPEN A LITTLE WALNUT TREE BOX HE HAD UPON THE TABLE AND BRING HIM SUCH A DRAWER WHICH I DID IN WHICH DRAWER THERE WAS A GREAT DEAL OF MONEY IN GOLD I BELIEVE NEAR TWO HUNDRED GUINEAS
328-129766-0067 BUT I KNEW NOT HOW MUCH HE TOOK THE DRAWER AND TAKING MY HAND MADE ME PUT IT IN AND TAKE A WHOLE HANDFUL I WAS BACKWARD AT THAT BUT HE HELD MY HAND HARD IN HIS HAND
328-129766-0068 WHEN I HAD DONE SO HE MADE ME PUT THEM INTO MY LAP AND TOOK MY LITTLE DRAWER
328-129766-0069 AND CARRY IT ALL HOME INTO MY OWN CHAMBER I RELATE THIS STORY THE MORE PARTICULARLY BECAUSE OF THE GOOD HUMOUR THERE WAS IN IT AND TO SHOW THE TEMPER WITH WHICH WE CONVERSED
328-129766-0070 AND IN A WORD PRESSED ME TO BUY BETTER
328-129766-0071 FOR I LOVED NOTHING IN THE WORLD BETTER THAN FINE CLOTHES I TOLD HIM I MUST HOUSEWIFE THE MONEY HE HAD LENT ME OR ELSE I SHOULD NOT BE ABLE TO PAY HIM AGAIN HE THEN TOLD ME IN A FEW WORDS THAT AS HE HAD A SINCERE RESPECT FOR ME AND KNEW MY CIRCUMSTANCES
328-129766-0072 AND THAT HE THOUGHT I HAD MERITED IT FROM HIM BY GIVING HIM MY COMPANY SO ENTIRELY AS I HAD DONE AFTER THIS HE MADE ME TAKE A MAID AND KEEP HOUSE
328-129766-0073 WHICH I DID VERY WILLINGLY BELIEVING AS IT APPEARED THAT I SHOULD LOSE NOTHING BY IT NOR DID THE WOMAN OF THE HOUSE FAIL TO FIND HER ACCOUNT IN IT TOO WE HAD LIVED THUS NEAR THREE MONTHS WHEN
328-129766-0074 THE COMPANY BEGINNING TO WEAR AWAY AT THE BATH HE TALKED OF GOING AWAY
328-129766-0075 I WAS NOT VERY EASY IN THAT PROPOSAL NOT KNOWING WHAT POSTURE I WAS TO LIVE IN THERE OR HOW HE MIGHT USE ME BUT WHILE THIS WAS IN DEBATE
328-129766-0076 CALLED SHEPTON WHERE HE HAD SOME BUSINESS AND WAS THERE TAKEN VERY ILL AND SO ILL THAT HE COULD NOT TRAVEL SO HE SENT HIS MAN BACK TO BATH TO BEG ME THAT I WOULD HIRE A COACH AND COME OVER TO HIM BEFORE HE WENT
328-129766-0077 HE HAD LEFT ALL HIS MONEY AND OTHER THINGS OF VALUE WITH ME AND WHAT TO DO WITH THEM I DID NOT KNOW BUT I SECURED THEM AS WELL AS I COULD AND LOCKED UP THE LODGINGS AND WENT TO HIM WHERE I FOUND HIM VERY ILL INDEED HOWEVER I PERSUADED HIM TO BE CARRIED
328-129766-0078 IN A LITTER TO THE BATH WHERE THERE WAS MORE HELP AND BETTER ADVICE TO BE HAD HE CONSENTED AND I BROUGHT HIM TO THE BATH WHICH WAS ABOUT FIFTEEN MILES AS I REMEMBER HERE HE CONTINUED VERY ILL OF A FEVER
328-129766-0079 AND KEPT HIS BED FIVE WEEKS ALL WHICH TIME I NURSED HIM AND TENDED HIM MYSELF
328-129766-0080 INDEED IF I HAD BEEN HIS WIFE I COULD NOT HAVE DONE MORE I SAT UP WITH HIM SO MUCH AND SO OFTEN THAT AT LAST INDEED HE WOULD NOT LET ME SIT UP ANY LONGER AND THEN I GOT A PALLET BED INTO HIS ROOM AND LAY IN IT JUST AT HIS BED'S FEET
328-129766-0081 I WAS INDEED SENSIBLY AFFECTED WITH HIS CONDITION AND WITH THE APPREHENSION OF LOSING SUCH A FRIEND AS HE WAS AND WAS LIKE TO BE TO ME AND I USED TO SIT AND CRY BY HIM MANY HOURS TOGETHER
328-129766-0082 HOWEVER AT LAST HE GREW BETTER AND GAVE HOPES THAT HE WOULD RECOVER AS INDEED HE DID THOUGH VERY SLOWLY WERE IT OTHERWISE THAN WHAT I AM GOING TO SAY I SHOULD NOT BE BACKWARD TO DISCLOSE IT
328-129766-0083 AS IT IS APPARENT I HAVE DONE IN OTHER CASES IN THIS ACCOUNT BUT I AFFIRM THAT THROUGH ALL THIS CONVERSATION ABATING THE FREEDOM OF COMING INTO THE CHAMBER WHEN I OR HE WAS IN BED AND ABATING THE NECESSARY OFFICES
328-129766-0084 OF ATTENDING HIM NIGHT AND DAY WHEN HE WAS SICK THERE HAD NOT PASSED THE LEAST IMMODEST WORD OR ACTION BETWEEN US OH THAT IT HAD BEEN SO TO THE LAST AFTER SOME TIME HE GATHERED STRENGTH AND GREW WELL APACE
328-129766-0085 AND I WOULD HAVE REMOVED MY PALLET BED BUT HE WOULD NOT LET ME TILL HE WAS ABLE TO VENTURE HIMSELF WITHOUT ANYBODY TO SIT UP WITH HIM AND THEN I REMOVED TO MY OWN CHAMBER
328-129766-0086 AND WHEN HE GREW QUITE WELL HE MADE ME A PRESENT OF FIFTY GUINEAS FOR MY CARE AND AS HE CALLED IT FOR HAZARDING MY LIFE TO SAVE HIS AND NOW HE MADE DEEP PROTESTATIONS OF A SINCERE INVIOLABLE AFFECTION FOR ME
328-129766-0087 BUT ALL ALONG ATTESTED IT TO BE WITH THE UTMOST RESERVE FOR MY VIRTUE AND HIS OWN I TOLD HIM I WAS FULLY SATISFIED OF IT HE CARRIED IT THAT LENGTH THAT HE PROTESTED TO ME THAT IF HE WAS NAKED IN BED WITH ME
328-129766-0088 AS HE WOULD DEFEND IT IF I WAS ASSAULTED BY A RAVISHER I BELIEVED HIM AND TOLD HIM I DID SO BUT THIS DID NOT SATISFY HIM HE WOULD HE SAID
328-129766-0089 WAS A GREAT WHILE AFTER THIS THAT I HAD OCCASION ON MY OWN BUSINESS TO GO TO BRISTOL UPON WHICH HE HIRED ME A COACH AND WOULD GO WITH ME AND DID SO AND NOW INDEED OUR INTIMACY INCREASED
328-129766-0090 TO HAVE NO LODGING IN THE INN BUT IN ONE LARGE CHAMBER WITH TWO BEDS IN IT
328-129766-0091 AND COMING INTO THAT ROOM SAID VERY FRANKLY TO HIM SIR IT IS NONE OF MY BUSINESS TO INQUIRE WHETHER THE LADY BE YOUR SPOUSE OR NO
328-129766-0092 WHICH DREW QUITE ACROSS THE ROOM AND EFFECTUALLY DIVIDED THE BEDS WELL SAYS MY FRIEND VERY READILY THESE BEDS WILL DO AND AS FOR THE REST WE ARE TOO NEAR AKIN TO LIE TOGETHER THOUGH WE MAY LODGE NEAR ONE ANOTHER
328-129766-0093 HE DECENTLY WENT OUT OF THE ROOM TILL I WAS IN BED AND THEN WENT TO BED IN THE BED ON HIS OWN SIDE OF THE ROOM BUT LAY THERE TALKING TO ME A GREAT WHILE AT LAST REPEATING HIS USUAL SAYING THAT HE COULD LIE NAKED IN THE BED WITH ME AND NOT OFFER ME THE LEAST INJURY
328-129766-0094 HE STARTS OUT OF HIS BED AND NOW MY DEAR SAYS HE YOU SHALL SEE HOW JUST I WILL BE TO YOU AND THAT I CAN KEEP MY WORD AND AWAY HE COMES TO MY BED I RESISTED A LITTLE BUT I MUST CONFESS I SHOULD NOT HAVE RESISTED HIM MUCH
328-129766-0095 IF HE HAD NOT MADE THOSE PROMISES AT ALL SO AFTER A LITTLE STRUGGLE AS I SAID I LAY STILL AND LET HIM COME TO BED WHEN HE WAS THERE HE TOOK ME IN HIS ARMS AND SO I LAY ALL NIGHT WITH HIM BUT HE HAD NO MORE TO DO WITH ME OR OFFERED ANYTHING TO ME
328-129766-0096 OTHER THAN EMBRACING ME AS I SAY IN HIS ARMS NO NOT THE WHOLE NIGHT BUT ROSE UP AND DRESSED HIM IN THE MORNING AND LEFT ME AS INNOCENT FOR HIM AS I WAS THE DAY I WAS BORN THIS WAS A SURPRISING THING TO ME
328-129766-0097 AND PERHAPS MAY BE SO TO OTHERS WHO KNOW HOW THE LAWS OF NATURE WORK FOR HE WAS A STRONG VIGOROUS BRISK PERSON NOR DID HE ACT THUS ON A PRINCIPLE OF RELIGION AT ALL BUT OF MERE AFFECTION INSISTING ON IT
328-129766-0098 THAT THOUGH I WAS TO HIM TO MOST AGREEABLE WOMAN IN THE WORLD YET BECAUSE HE LOVED ME HE COULD NOT INJURE ME
