978-125137-0000 CHAPTER SEVEN IN WHICH A FRIENDLY MOVE IS ORIGINATED THE ARRANGEMENT BETWEEN MISTER BOFFIN AND HIS LITERARY MAN MISTER SILAS WEGG SO FAR ALTERED WITH THE ALTERED HABITS OF MISTER BOFFIN'S LIFE
978-125137-0001 AS THAT THE ROMAN EMPIRE USUALLY DECLINED IN THE MORNING AND IN THE EMINENTLY ARISTOCRATIC FAMILY MANSION RATHER THAN IN THE EVENING AS OF YORE AND IN BOFFIN'S BOWER THERE WERE OCCASIONS HOWEVER WHEN MISTER BOFFIN SEEKING A BRIEF REFUGE FROM THE BLANDISHMENTS OF FASHION
978-125137-0002 WOULD PRESENT HIMSELF AT THE BOWER AFTER DARK TO ANTICIPATE THE NEXT SALLYING FORTH OF WEGG
978-125137-0003 IF WEGG HAD BEEN WORSE PAID FOR HIS OFFICE OR BETTER QUALIFIED TO DISCHARGE IT
978-125137-0004 BUT HOLDING THE POSITION OF A HANDSOMELY REMUNERATED HUMBUG HE RESENTED THEM THIS WAS QUITE ACCORDING TO RULE FOR THE INCOMPETENT SERVANT BY WHOMSOEVER EMPLOYED IS ALWAYS AGAINST HIS EMPLOYER EVEN THOSE BORN GOVERNORS NOBLE AND RIGHT HONOURABLE CREATURES
978-125137-0005 WHO HAVE BEEN THE MOST IMBECILE IN HIGH PLACES HAVE UNIFORMLY SHOWN THEMSELVES THE MOST OPPOSED SOMETIMES IN BELYING DISTRUST SOMETIMES IN VAPID INSOLENCE TO THEIR EMPLOYER WHAT IS IN SUCH WISE TRUE OF THE PUBLIC MASTER AND SERVANT IS EQUALLY TRUE OF THE PRIVATE MASTER AND SERVANT ALL THE WORLD OVER
978-125137-0006 WHEN MISTER SILAS WEGG DID AT LAST OBTAIN FREE ACCESS TO OUR HOUSE AS HE HAD BEEN WONT TO CALL THE MANSION OUTSIDE WHICH HE HAD SAT SHELTERLESS SO LONG AND WHEN HE DID AT LAST FIND IT IN ALL PARTICULARS AS DIFFERENT FROM HIS MENTAL PLANS OF IT AS ACCORDING TO THE NATURE OF THINGS IT WELL COULD BE
978-125137-0007 THAT FAR SEEING AND FAR REACHING CHARACTER BY WAY OF ASSERTING HIMSELF AND MAKING OUT A CASE FOR COMPENSATION AFFECTED TO FALL INTO A MELANCHOLY STRAIN OF MUSING OVER THE MOURNFUL PAST AS IF THE HOUSE AND HE HAD HAD A FALL IN LIFE TOGETHER
978-125137-0008 WAS ONCE OUR HOUSE THIS SIR IS THE BUILDING FROM WHICH I HAVE SO OFTEN SEEN THOSE GREAT CREATURES MISS ELIZABETH MASTER GEORGE AUNT JANE AND UNCLE PARKER' WHOSE VERY NAMES WERE OF HIS OWN INVENTING
978-125137-0009 AND HAS IT COME TO THIS INDEED AH DEAR ME DEAR ME SO TENDER WERE HIS LAMENTATIONS THAT THE KINDLY MISTER BOFFIN WAS QUITE SORRY FOR HIM AND ALMOST FELT MISTRUSTFUL THAT IN BUYING THE HOUSE HE HAD DONE HIM AN IRREPARABLE INJURY
978-125137-0010 TWO OR THREE DIPLOMATIC INTERVIEWS THE RESULT OF GREAT SUBTLETY ON MISTER WEGG'S PART BUT ASSUMING THE MASK OF CARELESS YIELDING TO A FORTUITOUS COMBINATION OF CIRCUMSTANCES IMPELLING HIM TOWARDS CLERKENWELL HAD ENABLED HIM TO COMPLETE HIS BARGAIN WITH MISTER VENUS
978-125137-0011 BRING ME ROUND TO THE BOWER SAID SILAS WHEN THE BARGAIN WAS CLOSED NEXT SATURDAY EVENING AND IF A SOCIABLE GLASS OF OLD JAMAIKEY WARM SHOULD MEET YOUR VIEWS I AM NOT THE MAN TO BEGRUDGE IT YOU ARE AWARE OF MY BEING POOR COMPANY SIR REPLIED MISTER VENUS BUT BE IT SO
978-125137-0012 IT BEING SO HERE IS SATURDAY EVENING COME AND HERE IS MISTER VENUS COME AND RINGING AT THE BOWER GATE MISTER WEGG OPENS THE GATE DESCRIES A SORT OF BROWN PAPER TRUNCHEON UNDER MISTER VENUS'S ARM AND REMARKS IN A DRY TONE
978-125137-0013 NO MISTER WEGG REPLIES VENUS I AM NOT ABOVE A PARCEL ABOVE A PARCEL NO SAYS WEGG WITH SOME DISSATISFACTION BUT DOES NOT OPENLY GROWL A CERTAIN SORT OF PARCEL MIGHT BE ABOVE YOU
978-125137-0014 HERE IS YOUR PURCHASE MISTER WEGG SAYS VENUS POLITELY HANDING IT OVER AND I AM GLAD TO RESTORE IT TO THE SOURCE FROM WHENCE IT FLOWED THANKEE SAYS WEGG
